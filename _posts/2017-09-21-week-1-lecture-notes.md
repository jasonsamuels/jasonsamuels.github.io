##Notes from Strategic Planning

* “Competence is its own motivation”
* This course is about expanding skill base to make the world better
* Very best strategic thinkers make a concerted effort to reflect
* Focus not just on the product but the process
* Facilitation is a strategic planning tool
* Strategic planning is not a substitute for leadership. There is no substitute for leadership.
* Strategic planning is often by design deliberately disruptive
* In practice, strategic planning rarely starts at step 1, and there are more ways to fail than to succeed.
* Big takeaway from class = need to think strategically about strategic planning. Need to have a good reason for doing it and design it to not go off the rails.
* Focus on what you control
* If you’re stuck in a situation, attack the barriers
* Build on strengths, capitalize on opportunities, minimize threats
* Re-thinking a situation can flip a threat to an advantage
* Changing the odds depends on understanding the systems

##Notes from Strategic Human Resources Management

* During class introductions I noticed that of the 12 students in class, 4 are from outside the United States. I'm really looking forward to hearing the perspectives they bring through the semester.
* Critical thinking skills are a priority, they transfer to the business world.
* “I hate rules” -- anecdote of trading off-the-books overtime for off-the-books time off later. Sometimes leaders bend rules to create a positive culture. The basic test is fairness.
* The head of an organization models the culture that org takes on.
* When you change CEOs, you change leadership approaches.
* Strategic Human Resources goes back to 1985. Core concept = HR should be more transformational than transactional
* Risk - you don’t want to unknowingly risk too much. But on the other hand, need some risk to innovate. Some orgs are so risk averse it’s stifling
* HR should take the lead in knowledge and change management
* A lot of SHR is about seeing HR function as being an internal consultant for people and an advocate for employees in the organization
* Empowerment means you’re also accepting responsibility.
