It was another week of top quality learning at the Humphrey School. In Strategic Planning we heard from a great guest speaker and did a competency mapping activity. In Strategic Human Resources Management we had a robust discussion about performance appraisals.

Today was my daughter's third birthday. I took a PTO day at work and we all went to the Como Zoo, where we've visited on all of her birthdays. It's a fun tradition and the progression of photos is great. Afterwards we came home, and while she slept my spouse and I wrapped presents and prepared a nice birthday dinner. Right now they're in bed as I'm cleaning up downstairs. It's not unusual for me to take a break from cleaning up to tackle an assigned reading or write a blog entry, like this one. But I need to keep it brief tonight. I still need to put the CSA veggies away, get the garbage cans out to the curb, and go to bed at a reasonable hour.

## Notes from Strategic Planning

This week's SP class featured a guest speaker who previously worked for 20 years for a consulting firm which did public sector strategy and visioning. They now work in a senior leadership role for a large nonprofit after having consulted with them to help craft their strategic plan. Now in charge of executing on strategy from the inside.

The second half of class was a short lecture by Prof Bryson, followed by an activity where we mapped competencies onto a causal map from [the week four purpose mapping activity](/class-notes-wk4-f17/#notes-from-strategic-planning).

* Livelihood schemes
* Most strategies in strategic plans are a hierarchy of actions. What’s left out are the competencies to follow through on those actions.
* Competency to engage in inquiry is a crucial skill
* If you’re going to succeed and be self-sustaining, you have to be better at things than other organizations are.
* Having a competency that’s not linked to an aspiration doesn’t do you much good. Livelihood schemes try to sort the competencies out to determine which ones are really crucial.
* What guest speaker was talking about in terms of sharpening the mission was making the mission distinctive
* Livelihood scheme starts with a purpose expansion, adds the competencies required

## Notes from Strategic Human Resources Management

* Tonight’s question: Should performance appraisals be used, and if so how?
* What is the difference between training and development?
  * Training is specific to task or job at hand; development builds competencies
* Which is more important?
  * Various perspectives, depends on situation
* **“When you train someone teach them the *how* .. when you teach someone you show them the *why.*”**
* Training is transactional, which is important, similar though to difference between management and leadership. Management can be trained
* Key aspects of training and development:
  * Needs assessment
  * Training and development objectives
  * Develop curriculum
  * Deliver
  * Evaluate
* Most popular training methods from McKinsey 2010 study:
  1. On the job teaching
  2. Formal/informal mentoring
  3. Individual learning online
* Performance evaluation as a tool
  * Organization wants some sense that there’s fairness occurring
  * Provides essential information for making personnel decisions
  * Class discussion - importance of objective measures of success in the performance eval process. Important to have goals defined at beginning of the year. Then even if a manager changes, the yardsticks remain in place to measure performance.
  * **If we think of performance appraisals as a process rather than an event, maybe we’ll be better off**
* There are situations where an employee does not make sufficient progress on correcting performance issues, and should be let go after progressive warning
* “One bad apple spoils the barrel” -- If you allow a poor performer to continue, it says to the organization that you don’t really care about performance.
* Why are performance appraisals important?
  1. Formal communication about job performance
  2. Can reinforce “integrity” and “openness” as organization values
  3. Can be a key part of performance management system - is the organization being served?
  4. Critical to employee development - is the employee being served?
* Should you do development planning at the same time as the performance appraisal?
  * Might be that if done concurrently, sends a message that it’s just a required thing that the manager doesn’t truly care about.
  * Class feedback - if done at the same time, might steer more focus to the things that are wrong than than things that are right, and therefore diminish impact of development.
* 360 reviews:
  * Time consuming
  * Reciprocity - don’t want to give someone a bad rating for fear they’ll give you one
  * Good to do periodically - every several years as a check in
  * Helps reinforce messages - one thing if your boss says it, another to hear the message coming from colleagues
* **If performance data isn’t useful then stop collecting it**
* Eight recommendations for performance evaluation:
  * Everyone must understand the evaluation system
  * Assess effectiveness of the current system
    * Who should assess this? Traditionally it’s HR. Suggest that it should be everyone
  * Train evaluators
  * Increase managers desire to conduct effective evaluations
  * Start with effective performance planning
  * Make informal evaluations ongoing
  * Provide resources to link pay to performance
  * Use employee anniversary dates to stagger evaluations
    * Healthy discussion on this point. Generally feel better to do them all at the same time in a cycle
* **A bad manager is someone who you don’t know where you stand with them**
* It’s hard to have a merit based system with a forced distribution
* Evaluating on demonstrated ability to learn - in part based on how long in the job
* **Ability to learn is a competence, which impacts a person’s ability to grow**
* Give people responsibility to go above-and-beyond to add value to the organization
* You really need to work to create the right setting if you want to encourage honest employee-to-supervisor feedback
