This is the last catchup post to get this blog up-to-current. The timing is serendipitous, the first SHRM paper is coming due and the instructions were to digest the first four weeks of material. So here's a great chance to go over that.

## Week one

### Strategic Human Resources Management Are We There Yet?, Becton and Schraeder (2009)

* SHR is concerned with the contributions HR strategies make to organizational effectiveness, and how these contributions are accomplished
* SHR expands the traditional role of HR from bureaucratic to strategic
* SHR can be more involved in transformations using change management techniques
  * can fulfill an important role in change management by helping upper management understand the fear of change and the negative reactions to it
* HR management tends to hold a micro view of the organization and HR managers are viewed as somewhat insular, focusing solely on day-to-day operations
* HR planning is important in its own right, must be done in concert with org's overall planning process
* importance of a need for a "fit" between HR strategy and overall business strategy
* many HR professionals may not have adequate understanding of business concepts that are critical for acceptance as a strategic partner.
* HR professionals should look to develop additional skill sets such as critical thinking, strategic planning, project management, organizational analysis, consulting,
and change management
* HR practitioners are somewhat short-term in their focus. In contrast, SHR requires a long-term focus
* HR can help demonstrate its value to the organization while tracking how well the organization is implementing various policies, systems, and initiatives
* HR professionals should take the initiative to add value to the organization over and above their transactional and administrative functions. By stepping up and adding value first, HR professionals can strengthen their status in organizations
* HR's shift to SHR is essential for both the viability of the field and for organizations everywhere. Research shows that SHR practices are positively associated with organizational performance indicators
