### Chapter 2, Managing Nonprofit Organizations, Tschirhart and Bielefeld (2012)
* what makes a good nonprofit?
* stakeholders can pull a nonprofit in different directions and lead to compromises that keep it from excelling
* which stakeholders’ interests should have the greatest priority and how to handle conflicts of interest
* nonprofits have a heightened responsibility to operate in an effective and ethical manner
* Scandals can raise concerns about the nonprofit sector as a whole
* <b>Multiple Dimensions for Evaluating Effectiveness</b>
  * **In the simplest terms, effective organizations are the ones that accomplish their mission**
  * difficult to judge the effectiveness of some nonprofits in the short term
  * Assessment of nonprofit organizational effectiveness requires multifaceted approaches that acknowledge the challenges of achieving complex, difficult, long-term missions
  * also need to recognize that effectiveness assessments may come from multiple stakeholders with different perspectives:
    * The first, the _goal accomplishment approach_, examines organizational output
    * resource _acquisition approach_ (sometimes called the system resource approach) focuses on inputs needed
    * _internal processes approach_, assesses the health and efficiency of internal dynamics
    * the _stakeholder approach_, looks at the satisfaction of stakeholders inside and outside the organization
    * how well the organization adapts over time (could be called _adaptation approach_)
* <b>Goal Accomplishment</b>
  * Unlike the business sector, which can comfortably use profit as a metric for success, the nonprofit sector should be careful to treat the amount of revenue generated or donations received as an input, not a goal.
  * Achievement of goals may not indicate achievement of mission
  * A nonprofit should set goals that are highly likely to align with its mission.
  * We recommend that goals be:
    * Measurable
    * Time bounded
    * Accepted
    * Challenging but feasible
    * Prioritized
* <b>Resource Acquisition</b>
  * a nonprofit can evaluate effectiveness in terms of the extent to which it has acquired the inputs needed to accomplish its mission
  * examples of types of inputs:
    * Human resources
    * Financial resources
    * Capital resources
    * Knowledge resources
    * Program resources
    * Community-based resources
  * this type of evaluation is best used when the level of a resource brought into an organization can be linked to its actual results
  * It is often easy and expected for a nonprofit to count and report inputs
  * Tracking inputs can reveal trends that leaders may want to investigate further
  * inputs provide a useful but limited perspective that can be complemented with other approaches
* <b>Internal Processes</b>
  * nonprofits may be judged on the efficiency, harmony, and ethics of their internal operations
  * Evaluation using internal process criteria may be especially useful when a nonprofit relies heavily on teamwork or has complicated technology.
  * A close look at the internal operations of a nonprofit can uncover areas for improvement as well as opportunities for praise.
  * In addition to revealing ethical concerns, internal reviews can reveal opportunities for improving efficiency
  * it is important to see efficiency not as an end in itself but rather as something that should be pursued to carefully steward resources
  * Nonprofit leaders who wish to demonstrate their nonprofit’s effectiveness on this dimension should focus on highlighting good internal management practices.
* <b>Stakeholder Satisfaction</b>
  * stakeholders have varying degrees of legitimate claims and power to influence the organization’s behavior.
  * relative level of satisfaction of these stakeholders is an additional gauge of an organization’s effectiveness
  * Some nonprofits’ primary function is to provide an outlet for participants’ ideas and beliefs
  * For these nonprofits, having high internal efficiency may undermine this part of their purpose.
  * For these types of nonprofits, stakeholders’ satisfaction with their involvement in the nonprofit can be a highly relevant effectiveness criterion.
  * Using a stakeholder satisfaction approach for evaluating effectiveness becomes more complex as the number and diversity of stakeholders that need to be considered grows
  * Stakeholder mapping is a technique nonprofit leaders can use to identify and strategize about stakeholders
* <b>Growth, Learning, and Adaptation</b>
  * evaluation can also focus on a nonprofit’s ability to respond to internal and external changes
  * Survival is a crude measure of effectiveness
  * The ability to adapt in order to capture new opportunities and reduce vulnerabilities and inefficiencies is a better indicator, but is more challenging to measure
  * With this approach, criteria include readiness for change and an ability to learn, making continuous improvements in quality and efficiency, and taking advantage of innovations
* <b>Taking a Balanced Approach</b>
  * One simple model is a triangle that identifies three components of an organization: mission and mandates, internal capacity, and external support
  * There are many tools to help nonprofits keep the triangle in balance
* <b>Ethics in Nonprofits</b>
  * Unethical behavior is not always premeditated or understood to be wrong by everyone involved
  * Ethical minefields within the nonprofit sector have led to calls for greater accountability, government regulation, protection of whistle-blowers, and codes of conduct
  * four levels of ethics:
    * _Personal ethics_
      * to an individual’s demographic and personality characteristics. Ethical behavior tends to be linked to an individual's demographic and personality characteristics
      * _Locus of control_ refers to how much control and responsibility individuals believe they have over what happens to them
      * leaders should not assume that because someone is involved with a nonprofit he or she is trustworthy
      * moral codes of the organization should be made clear to all to whom they apply, and organizational systems should be put in place
      * The work context can affect individual ethical conduct, so it is important for nonprofit leaders to explain and reinforce what is and is not acceptable behavior.
      * nonprofit leaders should evaluate the work setting to see if unethical behavior is being encouraged by overly high demands on workers that lead them to take inappropriate shortcuts, poor role models for ethical decision making, or compensation systems that make them feel it is OK to take resources from the organization because the pay is too low or because others do so without being sanctioned
      *  likelihood that employees will behave unethically increases when they perceive that the reward system is unfair, they are under excessive pressure to meet performance objectives, they are part of a group that is benefiting from acting unethically, or they think their leaders do not have a commitment to ethical standards
      * Reminding workers and board members of professional, organizational, and societal standards and codes can help keep unethical behaviors in check.
      * The goals of training should be to:
        * Build moral awareness
        * Frame moral decision making
        * Clarify moral intent
        * Encourage moral action
      * three general questions
        * Is it legal?
        * Is it balanced and fair to all concerned?
        * How will it make me feel about myself?
      * **If an employee can give positive answers to these questions, the action has passed a very basic ethics test.**
    * _Professional ethics_
      * In the case of certified professionals, breaking professional codes may cause them to lose their credentials
      * As more certified professionals trained in ethical conduct for their professions enter the nonprofit sector, we may see professional norms and standards spilling over to other job functions
      * By integrating professional standards for ethical conduct into their organization’s behavioral codes, they can avoid conflicts
    * _Organizational ethics_
      * One of the most influential methods may be to use values-based leadership
      * five core attributes of ethical nonprofit managers:
        * integrity
        * openness
        * accountability
        * service
        * charity
      * If leaders reflect these values, and encourage others in their organizations to do the same, they can build and maintain trust
      * A variety of organizational structures and systems can be used to encourage ethical behavior and signal accountability
    * _Societal ethics_
      * Societal pressures encourage nonprofits, and those working within them, to go beyond the letter of the law in the ethical level of their governance and operations.
      * The legal environment for nonprofits also serves as a check on unethical behavior
      * There is continued debate about the need for more regulation to encourage nonprofit accountability.
      * enthusiasm and capacity for self-regulation by members of the nonprofit sector is mixed.
      * Nonprofit leaders operating in diverse cultural contexts are likely to find a variety of interpretations of the ethics of situations and should be sensitive to cross-cultural differences.

### Ebrahim - The Many Faces of Nonprofit Accountability (2010)
* what does it mean to be accountable?
* At its core, accountability is about trust
* The challenge for leadership and management is to prioritize among competing accountability demands. This involves deciding both to whom and for what they owe accountability.
* purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the current debates on nonprofit accountability while also examining the trade-offs inherent in a range of accountability mechanisms.
* Numerous definitions of accountability have been offered. four core components:
  1. Transparency
  2. Answerability or justification
  3. Compliance
  4. Enforcement or sanctions
* For many observers, it is enforceability that ultimately gives any accountability mechanism power or “teeth.”
* accountability is not just about responding to others but also about “taking responsibility” for oneself
* has both an external dimension in terms of “an obligation to meet” and an internal one motivated by “felt responsibility”
* Most discussions about the concept thus also pose two further questions: _accountability to whom?_ and _accountability for what?_
* nonprofits are expected to be accountable to multiple actors:
  * upward to their funders or patrons
  * downward to clients
  * internally to themselves and their missions
* to whom one is accountable varies with organization type
  * _Membership organizations_ are largely oriented toward serving the interests of their members
  * _Service organizations_ - key accountability challenge lies in increasing “downward” accountability from funders to the nonprofit, and from the nonprofit to clients
  * _Policy advocacy networks_ - mechanisms of accountability available are advocacy-oriented (voice), including lobbying, litigation, protest, negotiation, fact-finding, and demanding transparency in the reporting of information and events. Accountability is collective in the sense that it depends on reliable coordination and pooling of resources among key players.
* demands of accountability “to whom” are multifold and can seldom be reduced to simple terms
* Accountability is a relational concept; it varies according to the relationships among actors, and it also varies across different types of organizations
* accountability is also about power, in that asymmetries in resources become important in influencing who is able to hold whom to account.
* <b>Accountability for What?</b>
  * nonprofit organizations are expected to be accountable for different things to different people. Expectations may be broken down into four broad, but far from comprehensive categories. accountability for:
    * _finances_
      * Accountability in this context is constituted as coercive or punitive, with an emphasis on disclosure and a reliance on legislative or regulatory oversight
    * _governance_
      * has often centered on the role of the board of directors
      * The board’s fiduciary responsibilities typically focus on its financial oversight role
      * The basic premise is that boards are responsible for oversight of internal controls and legal compliance
      * boards are increasingly also expected to be accountable for the broader purposes of the organization
      * These functions require much more than fiduciary oversight, demanding that boards play a more “generative” role, particularly in the development and maintenance of mission
    * _performance_
      * purpose ofsuch accountability is to demonstrate “results.”
      * often uses tools such as logic models
      * This kind of accountability relies on a range of technical and professional skills
      * This type of accountability is encouraged by funder reporting requirements that reward clear outputs and outcomes.
      * **critical observers have cautioned, however, that an overemphasis on measurable outcomes can lead to a push for quick fixes**
      * they stress a need to examine long-term effectiveness and less easily measurable goals related to political and social change
    * _mission_
      * fourth and more emergent type of accountability
      * might describe this as a mission-centered variant of performance-based accountability, which it extends in two respects
        * First, it embraces a long-term view of performance measurement by emphasizing iteration and learning. This suggests there are no panaceas to social problems, but instead that social problem solving requires an ability to cope with uncertainty and changing circumstances. Also indicates a critical role for nonprofit boards in internalizing the mission.
        * Second, organizational goals and strategies are themselves subject to adaptation. A central managerial challenge becomes putting in place processes that can engender systematic critical reflection and adaptation while remaining focused on solving social problems
  * These four "whats" are not mutually exclusive but are instead integrative
* <b>Accountability How?</b>
  * what then are the mechanisms of accountability actually available to them?
  * five broad (but far from comprehensive) types of accountability mechanisms used by nonprofits in practice
  * helpful to differentiate between mechanisms that are "tools" (discrete devices or techniques) and those that are "processes" (emphasizing a course of action)
    * _reports and disclosure statements_
      * Disclosure statements and reports are among the most widely used tools of accountability
      * On the one hand, such legal disclosures enable some degree of accountability to donors, clients, and members; also serve as means for nonprofit boards to fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities
      * On the other hand, donors and clients of a nonprofit organization in the United States generally have very limited legal standing to challenge an organization for falling short of legal requirements
      * At the same time, legal requirements can also be abused by governments to keep tabs on organizations that challenge them
      * not uncommon for nonprofit staff to complain about multiple reporting requirements
      * are significant tools of accountability in that they make available basic data on nonprofit operations. **Their distinct and tangible nature makes them easily accessible.**
      * Although no doubt important as deterrents, these external approaches have limited potential for encouraging organizations and individuals to take internal responsibility
    * _evaluations and performance assessments_
      * Funders commonly conduct external evaluations of nonprofit work near the end of a grant or program phase, and are increasingly employing mid-term assessments
      * typically aim to assess whether and to what extent program goals and objectives have been achieved
      * can be pivotal to future funding
      * may focus on short-term results, or medium-and-long-term results
      * evaluations often run into conflicts among nonprofits and funders over whether they should be assessing activities, processes, outputs, or outcomes and impacts (accountability for what)
      * nonprofit leaders have expressed concern about the difficulty, reliability, and expense of such measurement, particularly in accounting for causal factors well beyond their control
      * question of what should be evaluated may vary according to different stakeholders (accountability to whom)
        * When an organization's work is fairly straight forward to measure, a simple logic model can be helpful in clarifying results
        * When performance criteria vary among stakeholders, nonprofit leaders face the challenge of prioritizing and coordinating among multiple interests and constituents
      * Control over evaluations thus remains a central tension between nonprofits and their stakeholders
      * funders can come to somewhat different conclusions about the same set of nonprofits as a result of how they frame their evaluations
      * related concern raised by small nonprofits is that their limited staff and resources are stretched too thin by evaluation and reporting requests
      * concerns notwithstanding, the strength of evaluation as a mechanism of accountability lies in its explicit attention to results
    * _industry self-regulation_
      * Nonprofits have also increasingly turned to industry-wide accountability standards
      * the term refers specifically to efforts by nonprofit networks to develop standards or codes of behavior and performance, establishing norms around quality
      * standards and certification are most ubiquitous in the education and health care sectors
      * past two decades have seen the emergence of an array of voluntary codes of conduct and third-party certification standards across nonprofit industries
      * Some standards systems are inclusive in nature, seeking to improve governance across a spectrum of nonprofit
      * Others are exclusive in nature, seeking to screen organizations and professions
      * 1990s also saw the rise of state-level nonprofit associations adopting and promoting codes and certification standards
      * Whether and how the adoption of such self-regulation actually improves nonprofit accountability remains to be empirically tested
      * self-regulatory efforts face at least two challenges
        * First, as the number of such standards has grown, it has become difficult for donors and citizens to compare them
        * Second, although most self-regulatory efforts have focused internally on the governance and operations of their members (accountability for what), few have been explicit about accountability to key constituents (accountability to whom)
    * _participation_
      * As an accountability mechanism, participation is quite distinct from disclosure reports
      * helpful to distinguish between four levels or kinds of participation
        * At one level, participation public meetings or hearings, surveys, or a formal dialogue on project options. In this form, participation involves consultation with community leaders and members, but decision-making power remains with the project planners.
        * Second level of participation includes public involvement in actual project-related activities, and it may be in the form of community contribution towards labor or funds, possibly in the maintenance of services or facilities
        * Third level, citizens are able to negotiate and bargain over decisions with nonprofits or state agencies, or even hold veto power over decisions.
        * Fourth tier of participation, are people’s own initiatives that occur independently of nonprofit- and state-sponsored project. Examples include social movements
      * There have been a number of innovations in this area since the year 2000, especially in combining participation with evaluation to involve communities in evaluating nonprofits, or nonprofits in evaluating funders.
      * There have also been innovations in participatory budgeting, pioneered by citizens in municipalities in Brazil, and social audits and public hearings in which citizens assess the work of NGOs and governments
    * _adaptive learning_
      * Another process mechanism is adaptive learning, in which nonprofits create regular opportunities for critical reflection and analysis in order to make progress toward achieving their missions.
      * requires at least three sets of building blocks:
        * a supportive learning environment
        * concrete learning processes
        * supportive leadership
      * As an accountability mechanism, adaptive learning focuses internally on organizational mission
      * also offers a way for nonprofit leaders to address a common myopia—the focus on immediate short-term demands at the expense of longer-term and more sustained results
      * easier said than done
      * a number of global nonprofit organizations have been experimenting over the past decade with building learning into their work.
      * especially true of multisite organizations seeking to share knowledge across teams in dozens of countries
      * there has been a burst in the development of participatory tools for evaluation and learning such as outcome mapping, constituency feedback, and most significant change techniques
* although traditional approaches to improving accountability enable a degree of upward accountability, they are of limited use for enhancing downward accountability
* more balanced approach thus requires a greater role for nonprofits in evaluating funders and for clients in evaluating nonprofits.
* emergence of feedback tools such as grantee perception reports and constituency voice suggest that it is possible to find low-risk ways for nonprofits to express their views on funders
* **key point is that downward accountability mechanisms remain comparatively underdeveloped**
* improving accountability within nonprofits themselves also needs attention to a range of mechanisms
* In many cases the inducements are external
* **The key point here is that although externally driven mechanisms matter, the legitimacy and reputation of the social sector needs to be buttressed by internally driven mechanisms.**
* for a sector that views itself as largely mission-driven, there is an urgent need for nonprofit leaders to take performance assessment seriously in order to justify activities with substantiated evidence
* Funders that want nonprofits to measure impacts, but at the same time are unwilling to fund management capacity building and overhead costs for performance measurement, end up undermining both the nonprofits and themselves.
* third implication concerns the primary type of organizational response that a mechanism generates—whether it is:
  * _Compliance-driven accountability_ - a reactive response to concerns, about doing what one has to do
  * _Strategy-driven accountability_ - a proactive approach, focused on improving performance and achieving mission
* The most common mechanisms of accountability mainly serve a compliance purpose
* The complex nature of nonprofit work suggests, however, that attention to more strategic processes of accountability are necessary for lasting social and political change
* A strategy-driven accountability requires building internal capacity in nonprofits for adaptive learning
* In the end, accountability is both about being held to account by external actors and standards and about taking internal responsibility for actions
* nonprofit leaders facemultiple, and sometimes competing, accountability demands from numerous actors for varying purposes, requiring various levels of organizational response.
* current emphasis on the upward and compliance dimensions of accountability is problematic, skews organizational attention toward the interests of those who control critical resources
* **predominant emphasis on compliance-driven accountability tends to reward nonprofits for short-term responses with quick and tangible impacts, while neglecting longer-term strategic responses or riskier innovations** that can address more systemic issues
* inescapable that nonprofits will continue to face multiple and competing accountability demands
* **critical challenge for nonprofit leaders lies in finding a balance between upward accountability to their patrons while remaining true to their missions.**
* four key insights for practice:
  * Nonprofit leaders must be deliberate in prioritizing among accountabilities.
  * Nonprofits are expected to be accountable for multiple purposes: finances, governance, performance, and mission.
  * There are many mechanisms of accountability available to nonprofits
  * The broader conclusion is that accountability is not simply about compliance with laws or industry standards but is, more deeply, connected to organizational purpose and public trust

### Woods Nonprofit Accountability and Ethics: Rotting from the Head Down (2012)
* Arguably, the public holds nonprofits to higher ethical standards than government or businesses
* Do nonprofits listen to stakeholders?
* Based on Ethics Resource Center comprehensive data on ethics in nonprofits, nonproifts generally have a strong ethic culture compared to business or government. The difference, however, while statistically significant, is not impressive. Clearly, there is more work to do, even at the top of the scale.
* Although nonprofits may believe they have a strong ethical culture, this does not always translate into better ethical behavior or better reporting of unethical behavior.
* A sense of autonomy easily leads to a disregard for actively seeking input from stakeholders
* **Formally, nonprofits are answerable to state attorneys general, but they ought to feel answerable to the people they serve and the public as well.**
* Most nonprofit organizations may not discern the general public as a major actor, let alone the dominant one, yet it is the ultimate source of every privilege they enjoy
* It behooves all nonprofit organizations-but public charities particularly-to have a felt sense of obligation toward their constituents and toward the public
* Three markers of a responsible organization:
  * Responsible organizations are true to their missions
  * Responsible organizations act as if outcomes matter
  * Responsible organizations are candid.
* Four Trends Already Shaping Future Ethical Standards for Nonprofits
  * Small donors will demand that charities pay the same deference to their wishes and expectations that these charities have always accorded large donors.
  * Courts will become less tolerant of sweeping generalizations and vaguely misleading statements made by charities in the course of fundraising.
  * "The nonprofit community in the United States (and increasingly elsewhere) has begun to shift its attention from measuring outputs as indicators of progress to measuring outcomes.''
  * More regulation. A minimal ethical standard is obedience to the law.
* In some ways, our financial models are a setup for irresponsibility because they often have us paid by one stakeholder to provide service to another.
* nonprofits have a greater power advantage relative to the people they serve than for-profit businesses have relative to their customer
* More and more often, however, perhaps aided by social media, stakeholders are realizing that they can protest unaccountability.
* A strong culture features four major components:
  1. ethical leadership
  2. supervisor reinforcement of ethics
  3. peer commitment to ethics
  4. embedded ethical values

### Rhode & Packel Ethics and Nonprofits (2009)
* Unethical behavior remains a persistent problem in nonprofits and for-profits alike
* 2008 Brookings Institution survey found that about one third of Americans reported having "not too much" or no confidence in charitable organizations, and 70 percent felt that charitable organizations waste "a great deal" or a "fair amount" of money.
* Only 10 percent thought charitable organizations did a "very good job" spending money wisely; only 17 percent thought that charities did a "very good job" of being fair in decisions; and only one quarter thought charities did a "very good job" of helping people
* a 2006 Harris Poll found that only one in 10 Americans strongly believed that charities are honest and ethical in their use of donated funds
* public perceptions are particularly troubling for nonprofit organizations that depend on continuing financial contributions
* Addressing these ethical concerns requires a deeper understanding of the forces that compromise ethical judgment and the most effective institutional responses
* <b>Causes of Misconduct</b>
  * common ethical problems involve gray area
  * four crucial factors that influence ethical conduct:
    * Moral awareness
    * Moral decision making
    * Moral intent
    * Moral action
  * Cognitive biases can compromise these ethical capacities.
  * A related bias involves cognitive dissonance: people tend to suppress or reconstrue information that cases doubt on a prior belief or action
  * In-group biases can also result in unconscious discrimination
  * A person's ethical reasoning and conduct is also affected by organizational structures and norms
  * In charitable organizations, employees who feel excessive pressure to generate revenue or minimize administrative may engage in misleading conduct
  * perceptions of unfairness in reward systems increase the likelihood of unethical behavior
  * A variety of situational pressures can also undermine moral conduct
  * In real-world settings, when instructions come from supervisors and jobs are on the line, many moral compasses go missing.
  * influence of peers on individual decision making: people are more likely to engage in unethical conduct when acting with others
  * especially likely when organizations place heavy emphasis on loyalty and offer significant rewards to team players
  * Once people yield to situational pressures when the moral cost seems small, they can gradually slide into more serious misconduct.
  * Moral blinders are especially likely in contexts where people lack accountability for collective decision making.
  * Other characteristics of organizations can also contribute to unethical conduct
  * Large organizations facing complex issues may undermine ethical judgments by fragmenting information across multiple departments
  * Work may be allocated in ways that prevent decision makers from seeing the full picture
  * Another important influence is ethical climate - organizations signal their priorities in multiple ways
  * Workers also respond to moral cues from peers and leaders. Virtue begets virtue, and observing integrity in others promotes similar behavior.
* <b>Ethical Issues in the Nonprofit Sector</b>
 * organizational dynamics play out in distinctive ways in the nonprofit sector.
 * six areas in particular where ethical issues arise in the nonprofit sector
  * <b>Compensation</b>
    * Salaries that are modest by business standards can cause outrage in the nonprofit sector, particularly when the organization is struggling to address unmet societal needs.
    * also the perks that officers and unpaid board members may feel entitled to take because their services would be worth so much more in the private sector.
    * The Panel on the Nonprofit Sector recommends in its Principles for Good Governance and Ethical Practice that organizations establish clear written policies about what can be reimbursed and require that travel expenses be cost-effective
  * <b>Conflicts of Interest</b>
    * arise when an organization offers preferential treatment to board members or their affiliated companies
    *  In a recent survey, a fifth of nonprofits (and two-fifths of those with more than UO million in annual expenses) reported buying or renting goods, services, or property from a board member or an affiliated company within the prior two years.
    * Despite the ethical minefield that these transactions create, many nonprofits oppose restrictions because they rely on insiders to provide donations or goods and services at below-market rate
    * quid pro quo relationships can jeopardize an organization's reputation for fairness and integrity in its financial dealings
    * nonprofits need detailed, unambiguous conflict of interest policies
    * policies should also demand total transparency about the existence of potential conflicts and the process by which they are dealt
  * <b>Publications and Solicitation</b>
    * nonprofits need to pay particular attention to transparency.
    * disclose in a clear and non-misleading way the percentage of funds spent on administrative cost
    * Transparency is also necessary in solicitation materials, grant proposals, and donor agreements.
  * <b>Financial integrity</b>
    * Recently, many corporations have been attempting to "green" their image through affiliations with environmental organizations, and some of these groups have been entrepreneurial in capitalizing on such interests.
    * There are no easy resolutions of these issues, but there are better and worse ways of addressing them.
    * Appearances matter, and it sometimes makes sense to avoid affiliations where a donor is seeking to advance or pedigree ethically problematic conduct
  * <b>Investment Policies</b>
    * In its strongest form, this strategy calls for investing in ventures that further an organization's mission
    * In its weaker form, the strategy entails divestment from companies whose activities undermine that mission
    * Many nonprofit leaders have resisted pressure to adopt socially responsible investing principles on the grounds that maximizing the financial return on investment is the best way to further their organization's mission
    * **To have one set of principles for financial management and another for programmatic objectives sends a mixed moral message**
    * to compartmentalize ethics inevitably marginalizes their significance
    * About a fifth of institutional investing is now in socially screened fund
  * <b>Accountability and Strategic Management</b>
    * nonprofit organizations are not subject to the checks of market forces or majoritarian control.
    * independence has come under increasing scrutiny in the wake of institutional growth
    * public role also entails significant public responsibilities
    * responsibilities include fiduciary obligations to stakeholder
    * accountability requires a well-informed plan for furthering organizational objectives and specific measures of progress.
    * Money held in public trust should be well spent, not just well-intentioned.
    * Although in many contexts objective measures of progress are hard to come by, it is generally possible to identify some indicators or proxies
    * The effectiveness of evaluation is likely to increase if organizations become more willing to share information about what works and what doesn't
    * What nonprofit wants to rain on its parade when that might jeopardize public support? But sometimes at least a light drizzle is essential to further progress.
* <b>Promoting Ethical Decision Making</b>
  * nonprofits can take three steps that will make it more likely:
    * Ensure Effective Codes of Conduct and Compliance Programs
    * Promote Effective Financial Management
    * Institutionalize an Ethical Culture
* Leaders face a host of issues where the moral course of action is by no means self-evident.
* although there may be no unarguably right answers, some will be more right than other
* leaders should strive for a decision making process that is transparent and responsive to competing stakeholder interests.
* Nonprofit executives and board members also should be willing to ask uncomfortable questions
* Not only do leaders need to ask those questions of themselves, they also need to invite unwelcome answers from others.
* people in positions of power should actively solicit diverse perspectives and dissenting views
* Our global economy is paying an enormous price for moral myopia, and we cannot afford its replication in the nonprofit sphere.

### Better Business Bureau - Wise Giving Alliance Standards for Charity Accountability
* BBB Wise Giving Alliance Standards for Charity Accountability were developed to assist donors in making sound giving decisions and to foster public confidence
* standards seek to encourage fair and honest solicitation practices, to promote ethical conduct by charitable organizations and to advance support of philanthropy
* Organizations that comply with these accountability standards have provided documentation that they meet basic standards:
  * In how they govern their organization
  * In the ways they spend their money
  * In the truthfulness of their representations
  * In their willingness to disclose basic information to the public.
* **overarching principle is full disclosure to donors at the time of solicitation and thereafter**
* As voluntary standards, they also go beyond the requirements of local, state and federal laws and regulations
* In addition to the specific areas addressed in the standards, adopt the following management practices to further the cause of charitable accountability:
  * Initiate a policy promoting pluralism and diversity
  * Ensure adherence to all applicable local, state and federal laws
  * maintain an organizational commitment to accountability that transcends specific standards
* <b>Governance and oversight</b>
  * A board of directors that provides adequate oversight of the charity's operations and its staff.
  * A board of directors with a minimum of five voting members
  * A minimum of three evenly spaced meetings per year of the full governing body
  * Not more than one or 10% (whichever is greater) directly or indirectly compensated person(s) serving as voting member(s) of the board.
  * No transaction(s) in which any board or staff members have material conflicting interests
* <b>Measuring effectiveness</b>

* <b>Working Toward Diversity</b>
  * To be effective, all grantmakers must gain new competencies and experiences in diversity to guide them in doing the work of philanthropy.
  * This special chapter offers foundations and corporate giving programs some fresh ideas, good practices and current examples of diversity work in the field
  * In devising a framework for applying the diversity principle, the Minnesota Council on Foundations has identified four distinct grantmaker roles:
    * _funder_
      * wealth of opportunities to foster diversity
      * commitment to inclusion policies may trigger a whole new way of thinking about grantmaking and how best to reach a diverse constituency
    * _employer_
      * shapes its staff and can also determine the composition of its board
      * provides important opportunities to bring diversity, in all its meanings, inside the institution.
    * _civic participant_
      * contribute to the public good through involvement in communities, not just through funding.
      * earn about the needs and issues of diverse constituencies
      * act as facilitators and initiators of community action
      * offer technical assistance and draw upon resources that would be unavailable to many small nonprofits
      * become equal partners in their communities, gaining valuable insight and knowledge through firsthand experience.
    * _economic entity_
      * direct its financial activities in ways that amplify a commitment to inclusion and complement its grantmaking mission
      * Socially responsible investment policies are one way
      * Supporting businesses owned by marginalized populations is another strategy
