### The CIO as Venture Capitalist, CISR Research Briefing Vol XVI, June 2016

* We think there is a sea change coming for CIOs and it will be about helping the company drive more innovation and growth.
* innovation is becoming an increasingly important role of CIOs
* startling difference between the CIOs of top-performing firms and bottom-performing firms
* CIOs of top-performing firms spend 53% of their time on innovation, CIOs at bottom performing firms spend only 19%
* Bottom line impacts were clear: 49% of top-performing firms' revenues came from products or services introduced in the last three years
* In this briefing we explore
an emerging new role for the CIO: acting as a venture capitalist (VC).
* CIOs acting as VCs work with a broad range of companies, typically smaller ones, to bring innovations into the company and accelerate time to market
* three approaches that the CIO Venture Capitalist takes to increase innovation are:
  * Learn: Invest to Develop Capabilities You Don't Have but Need
  * Acquire: Bring in Revenue Streams or Talent-or Both
  * Partner: Build a Portfolio of New Business Experiments
* the IT unit has to become the
first place to look in the enterprise for IT-based innovation
* **change can't happen overnight-the IT unit has to be perceived not only as being business focused but also possessing strong innovation and technology skills**
* four skills that are key for a more proactive role in innovation:
  * Scanning the environment for new technology opportunities and then proactively helping the enterprise learn, acquire, and partner to produce benefits
  * Investing and experimenting with a portfolio of high-potential technologies
  * Working on teams with line-of-business executives to identify opportunities for value creation from new technologies
  * Brokering, negotiating, funding, investing, joint venturing, and then integrating new technologies into the enterprise
* **The CIO-and by extension, the IT unit-needs to become more of a venture capitalist, helping the rest of the company to incorporate and leverage the innovative capacity of new technologies**

### Ross, J and Beath C. “Beyond the Business Case: New Approaches to IT Investments”, Sloan Management Review, Winter 2002

* As IT becomes more closely tied to business objectives, successful investment must consider two dimensions: technology scope and strategic objectives
* In the last 15 years, a tidal wave of IT-enabled initiatives, from business-process reengineering to enterprise-resource planning, has elevated the importance of investing strategically in IT.
* although the opportunities seem limitless, the resources required (capital, IT expertise, management focus and capacity for change) are not.
* Traditional approaches to IT investment attempt to identify projects with the best profit potential
* heightened strategic importance of IT, however, has forced companies to think differently
* complex trade-offs are leading to new IT-investment patterns
* Our perspective is that lasting pressures have permanently changed how companies approach the problem of justifying IT investments.
* technological and market changes are intensifying dependence on IT
* prudent to adopt new investment strategies not as exceptions, but as part of a deliberate rationale that says success comes from using multiple approaches to justifying IT investments
* Investments differ along two dimensions: strategic objectives and technology scope
* To address both dimensions companies need to make four distinct types of investment:
  * <b>Transformation</b>
    * Transformation investments are necessary when an organization's core infrastructure limits its ability to develop applications critical to long-term success
    * triggered by the growing need for integrated customer data, end-to-end processing and platforms that provide around-the-clock support
    * often risky, undertaken when companies have determined that not rebuilding infrastructure significantly is even riskier
  * <b>Renewal</b>
    * potential benefits of renewal initiatives include improving maintainahility, reducing support and training requirements, and making existing capacity more efficient
    * may be driven by a vendor's decision to withdraw support from older products
  * <b>Process Improvement</b>
    * Business process improvements should be low-risk investments because, unlike transformation initiatives, they focus on operational outcomes of existing processes.
  * <b>Experiments</b>
    * Successful experiments can lead to major organizational change with accompanying infrastructure changes or to more incremental process-improvement initiatives.
* Although the four types of IT investment are conceptually distinct, they are difficult to distinguish in practice
* **Investments in shared infrastructure will shape, for better or worse, the opportunities available. If senior management directs transformation investments with that in mind, the company's overall IT capability is more likely to support its strategic business direction.**
* Distinguishing between experiments and the investments that successful experiments trigger presents a different challenge
* companies can, and should, make a distinction between an investment in an experiment designed to reveal profitability estimates and an investment in a process improvement that is expected to yield additional profits
* toughest distinction is between transformation and renewal
* Renewal may foster process improvement, but that is not its primary objective. Transformation, on the other hand, intentionally changes an enterprise's infrastructure in ways that not only enable, but usually demand, process change
* Process owners should not fund renewals of technologies that are expensive for IT to support unless they accept responsibility for achieving the expected IT-service efficiencies.
* need a pool of resources for each type of investment. That raises two issues:
  * <b>how to distribute funds across investment types</b>
    * Companies that leverage IT effectively instinctively make distinctions similar to those described in our IT-investment framework
  * <b>how to establish priorities within investment types</b>
    * Ways of prioritizing differ according to the investment's technology scope and business objectives.
      * _Funding Transformation_
        * transformation investments demand significant senior-management commitment to invest the funds, guide implementation and process change, and steer the organization toward opportunities to leverage the investments.
        * effective IT transformation starts with understanding IT costs in a company and applying principles of activity-based cost management.
        * ultimately most companies rely on competitive analysis and executive instinct
      * _Funding Renewal_
        * Most renewal initiatives reduce the cost and raise the quality of IT services and thus can be justified with traditional business case
      * _Funding Process Improvement_
        * usually cross-functional and strategic. Thus they often are funded centrally
        * funding process-improvement projects separately from infrastructure allows companies to clarify the goals and expected returns of each investment alternative
      * _Funding IT Experiments_
        * No one we talked to had figured out a way to put a value on the learning benefits so as to persuade a capital-budgeting committee to invest in experiments
        * For the foreseeable future will likely be based on the enthusiasms and intuitions of sponsoring business managers or specially funded organizational unit
* Companies should formally establish four pools of resources and then avoid the temptation to underfund one or more of the IT-investment type
* multipronged approach to IT investment is crucial for companies attempting to harness the power of IT in shaping business opportunities

### Nils Fonstad and David Robertson, “Transforming a Company Project by Project: the IT Engagement Model”, MISQ Executive, Vol 5(1), 2006

Executive summary:
* Information Technology (IT) organizations have long struggled with achieving companywide strategies while simultaneously responding to urgent requests from business units
* Our studies suggest that successful approaches address two fundamental goals:
  * alignment between IT and the rest of the business
  * coordination across multiple organizational levels
* define our model as the system of mechanisms that brings together key stakeholders to ensure that projects achieve both local and company-wide objectives
* three general components:
  * company-wide IT governance
  * project management
  * linking mechanisms
* linking mechanisms are crucial but not well understood

Text:
* Two streams of research have addressed the challenge of IT organizations aiming to achieve company-wide strategies while simultaneously responding to urgent request
* top-down research approach has focused on _IT governance_
  * This research has studied the key decisions that IT and non-IT senior managers must address
* bottom-up research approach has focused on _project management_
  *  This research has studied how IT departments ensure that projects are on time and on budget
* Neither approach fully addresses how IT organizations can simultaneously pursue both company-wide and local objectives.
* **Success requires the concerted efforts of multiple stakeholders and maintaining a healthy balance between strategic and tactical demands**
* details of a final solution often only emerge over time and can be difficult to anticipate
* successful approaches address both alignment between IT and the rest of the business and coordination across multiple organizational levels.
* They achieve both alignment and coordination by linking company-wide IT governance with project governance and by engaging multiple stakeholder groups
* We define our IT engagement model as _the system of mechanisms that brings together key stakeholders to ensure that projects achieve both local and company-wide objectives._ Consists of three components
  * Company-wide IT governance
  * Project management
  * Linking mechanisms
* Each component is made up of a set of mechanisms, which can include groups, processes, and roles
* As a set, these mechanisms enable and constrain communication among stakeholders
* Linking mechanisms are the heart of a company’s IT engagement model because they enable ideas to flow back and forth between company-wide IT governance and project management.
* ensure that high-level governance decisions are understood and implemented by project teams
* Linking mechanisms connect key governance decisions with projects by means of regular access points
* enable stakeholders from different organizational levels to manage interdependencies, identify commonalities across business units and projects, and negotiate conflicting demands
* <b>Problems with Two Traditional Approaches to IT Projects</b>
  * _"big bang" approach_ often used For company-wide initiatives, like ERP, CRM, or SCM
    * difficulties encountered in this approach are well known
    * responsibility for implementing new systems and associated business process changes is too often handed off to IT
    * IT's effectiveness has often been limited by its lack of engagement with the rest of the business
  * _solutions tailored to specific local needs_ are often favored for local business initiatives
    * higher probability of locally defined "success"
    * When developed without coordination via company-wide IT governance, these solutions provided little help in achieving company-wide goals
    * IT infrastructure spaghetti
    * Presents a significant source of operational, financial, and strategic risk to the company
* <b>Six stakeholder groups</b>
  * high-level managers seek to optimize resource use, reduce redundancies, and coordinate activities across the company.
  * top-level IT personnel (CIO, chief architect, and their direct reports) aim to maximize business value from IT
  * managers look across many projects to make sure they collectively meet business unit goals
  * IT group at the business unit level focuses on maximizing the value from IT for that business unit
  * business managers are primarily interested in optimizing their project
  * Project-level IT managers seek to support their business counterparts by developing the best IT solutions as quickly as possible
* <b>Company-wide IT Governance</b>
  * Weill and Ross definition of company-wide IT governance as the organizational distribution of “decision rights and accountabilities to encourage desirable behavior in the use of IT.”
  * five major IT decisions (which they call domains):
    * IT principles
    * enterprise architecture
    * infrastructure strategies
    * business application needs
    * investment priorities
  * **effective IT governance involves both IT and non-IT stakeholders**
  * Companies with good governance get 40% more value from IT
  * Examples of mechanisms used for company-wide IT governance:
    * enterprise architecture committee
    * CIO representation on senior business strategy team
    * chargeback processes
    * formal IT investment and prioritization process
* <b>Project Management</b>
  * emerged as a critical competence
  * A good project management methodology has well-defined process steps with clear deliverables and metrics to be reviewed at regular checkpoints
  * presents a valuable opportunity for engagement between IT and non-IT decision makers
  * Examples of mechanisms used for company-wide IT governance:
    * project management office
    * industry-standard methodology
    * project tracking software tool
    * project manager role
* <b>Linking Mechanisms</b>
  * linking mechanisms are mechanisms that link project management with company-wide IT governance
  * they ensure that project teams remain coordinated and aligned with higher-level strategies throughout their lifecycle
  * enables independent stakeholders to negotiate their differences, influence one another, learn from each other, develop trust across the company, and collectively achieve local and company-wide objectives.
  * three categories of linking mechanisms:
    * _Business linkage mechanisms_ work vertically up and down the organization, linking projects to company-level and business-level strategies. They include:
      * Process owners responsible for the structure and performance of standard business processes
      * Strategy boards that manage across project
      * Funding reviews
      * Reward systems that encourage the achievement of company-wide goals
    * _Architecture linkage mechanisms_ work vertically, linking projects to company and business unit architectures. Companies may put together a system of such mechanisms, such as:
      * an architecture office
      * architects on projects
      * an exceptions-handling process to:
        * establish and update standards
        * review projects for compliance
        * approve and manage exceptions
      * Another powerful mechanism is an architecture-driven funding process
    * _Alignment linkage mechanisms_ work horizontally, linking IT with the rest of the business
      * Both company-wide IT governance and project management include mechanisms that companies use to improve alignment.
      * several firms introduced additional mechanisms, most common of which was to formally introduce the role of integrator
      * in the companies that we studied, alignment linkage mechanisms were always integrated into a broader system of mechanisms.
* seven principles for ensuring that IT governance, project management, and linking mechanisms lead to successful engagement:
  * Build on a foundation of good IT governance and project management
  * Make strategic objectives clear, specific, and actionable
  * Motivate to meet company goals
  * Define enforcement authority
  * Emphasize early intervention and prevention
  * Maintain transparent, regular, two-way communication
  * Involve the right people
* two major predictors of the strategic effectiveness of architectural initiatives:
  * degree to which senior managers were involved in defining and overseeing architecture initiatives
  * degree to which the architecture effort was well linked to project activities
* Companies generally test out a variety of mechanisms to see which ones fit their situation best. As stakeholders learn to engage, they adapt existing mechanisms or replace them with new ones.
* Linking mechanisms, integrated with the mechanisms that make up company-wide IT governance and project management, form a system of mechanisms that we call the IT engagement model.
* Two ways to illustrate your company’s system of mechanisms:
  * first approach is to draw a top-down organizational view
  * ask yourself four questions:
    * What mechanisms do our IT governance bodies use to reach and to enforce their decisions?
    * How do these mechanisms interact with our projects?
    * How are our projects coordinated?
    * What linking mechanisms connect our projects to business leadership? To IT leadership? To IT architects?
  * second approach is to take a project-focused view.
  * Choose an important strategic initiative and ask the project manager three questions:
    * If you were to attach yourself to the initiative and follow it from inception to completion, what mechanisms would it experience?
    * For each mechanism, describe who provides inputs and who is authorized to make the final decision.
    * How do these mechanisms enable or constrain business-IT alignment across organizational levels? How do the mechanisms enable or constrain coordination across the company and within IT?
* Once you have drawn these two pictures ask yourself the following five questions:
  * Are the right people involved? Is there good involvement at all levels?
  * Is there real authority, or are people ignoring the mechanisms when they’re not convenient?
  * Do people understand how the IT strategy and enterprise architecture support the business strategy?
  * Does IT get involved early in projects?
  * Is it clear to everyone why the engagement model exists and how it functions?
* the three key components of the engagement model—IT governance, project management, and linking mechanisms—help companies take on the right projects, execute them well, and, when taken together, collectively help the
company achieve its goals.
* **By effectively engaging across all parts of the company, real company-wide transformation can be achieved, funded by business-driven initiatives, one project at a time.**

### Meridith Levinson. “Don’t Stop Thinking About Tomorrow.” CIO.com, 2000

* with scenario planning you can devise strategies based on what you can discern about the future
* scenario planning can:
  * Help you manage risk
  * Make you aware of the factors influencing your decisions
  * Provide you and your colleagues with a common vocabulary for discussing strategies
* Scenario planning can work for any company, provided that company has the time, resources and commitment of its executive team
* **Scenario planning is an exercise in contingency thinking**
* in order to create a vision for the future that makes sense to the company, you have to get into the minds of the decision-makers.
* After narrowing the bank's possible future to those three, the team compiled a list of 150 internal and external events that might influence any of the outcomes
* the first day of the three-day workshop, executives gathered in a conference room, were divided into four groups and told to rank all 150 events based on likelihood to occur
* purpose of this part of the workshop is to sensitize participants to the assumptions and biases they have about various issues.
* If participants were split on the likelihood of an event, they attempted to reach a consensus.
* Next, each group was assigned a possible scenario and over two days were charged with analyzing how the various events that they ranked might influence it
* "This scenario-based planning exercise recognizes that an end-state four or five years from today is really not just a single end-state but a journey from today through a lot of events leading up to that endpoint"
* **With scenario planning, National City may still not ultimately control its fate, but at least all its business units now share a single strategic vision**
* "Scenario planning helped [the IT group] understand the issues the business heads handle every day,"
* "Scenario planning forced us to ask the business side specific questions about the level of customization they wanted"
* Participants on the business side also gained valuable perspective
* The exercise "established a short-hand or common nomenclature for some generic strategies that still facilitates communication today,"
* Because of the exercise, the company now draws up a yearly set of critical initiatives around its strategy
* "Scenarios help companies recognize the future as it unfolds so that they can see the signals of change in a more timely way,"
* "It enables you to manage risk differently. Because you understand your risks better you have more maneuvering room and can act with more confidence"
* Here's a framework you can follow:
  * _Before the workshop_
    * Build end-states and events
    * Rank outcomes
  * _During the workshops_
    * Assess the likelihood of events
    * Build and advocate scenarios
    * Revise rankings
    * Compare old and new thinking
    * Develop event-driven strategy
* There are, of course, drawbacks to scenario planning. "This is not something that can be done quick and dirty and cranked out by a junior staffer. It takes serious research, significant resources, time and engagement [from the management team]"
* **To do it well companies must first understand the question or decision they're dealing with**
