### Chapter 7, Managing Nonprofit Organizations, Tschirhart and Bielefeld (2012)

* transformation from financial distress to financial empowerment was due to three factors: data, discipline, and dialogue
* proper financial management can help a nonprofit be more successful with its mission, avoid allegations of improprieties, and reduce the risk of unethical and illegal behavior
* Financial management systems are critical for demonstrating adherence to the law and accountability
* in this chapter we discuss seven elements of an effective financial management system:
  * financial policies
  * accounting
  * budgeting
  * banking relations
  * borrowing
  * risk management
  * auditing and financial analysis
* <b>Financial policies</b>
  * _Conflict of Interest Policy_
    * A 2006 study revealed that 21 percent of nonprofits bought or rented goods, services, or property from a board member
    * In some U.S. states, financial transactions between a nonprofit and its board and staff members are illegal
    * Nonprofits should supply training for board and staff members (paid and volunteer), with specific examples of the ways in which the nonprofit’s conflict of interest policies might be violated and what to do in situations where the policy is unclear
    * should be clear on procedures that will be followed once a conflict of interest is disclosed
    * When board and staff members understand why the conflict of interest policies are important and what steps will be taken to enforce them, it is more likely that they will follow them.
    * Gratuities, kickbacks, and loans are ripe for conflict of interest concerns
    * A kickback, which is a payment from a vendor in return for getting the nonprofit’s business, is illegal.
    * A loan from a nonprofit to a board or staff member can also be considered inappropriate
    * Sarbanes-Oxley Act explicitly forbids private loans to insiders in for-profit corporations but does not extend this rule to nonprofits
    * some states recommend or require that nonprofits not provide loans to board members and executives
  * _Whistle-Blower Protection Policy_
    * A nonprofit must report in its IRS Form 990 whether it has adopted a whistleblower policy
    * The Sarbanes-Oxley Act makes it a federal crime retaliate against an employee who reports suspected fraudulent activities
    * Nonprofits should give employees and board members options for sharing concerns and should have mechanisms to ensure that the concerns are reviewed and not ignored
  * _Budget Reserve Policy_
    * should set a policy to budget funds in reserve at a certain level
    * having a reserve fund that is controlled by board vote allows a nonprofit to avoid taking out expensive loans or running a large line of credit.
    * however, funders typically take a dim view of what they perceive as an overly large reserve
    * Having a policy set by the board about the amount of the reserve fund helps in addressing the great variation in opinion that may exist about what it should be
  * _Investment Policy_
    * The board must decide whether to pursue a passive or active investment strategy and spell out the values that will guide investment choices
    * In addition to designating the investment risk orientation, the investment policy also specifies the types of investments the nonprofit can use.
  * _Document Retention Policy_
    * Even if the retention period for documents has passed, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that document purging must stop if an official investigation or bankruptcy proceeding is under way
* <b>Accounting</b>
  * _Accounts_
    * summary snapshot: _Assets - Liabilities = Net Assets_
    * basic accounting equation: _Revenues - Expenses = Net Income or Net Loss_
  * _The Accounting Cycle_
    * refers to a process that allows for the accurate recording and summarizing of transactions by an organization
    * gist of the process consists of three key activities:
      * Documenting
      * Recording
      * Reporting
  * _Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)_
    * Uniform accounting standards help to ensure that the financial statements generated by different organizations are consistent and comparable
    * In 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC, or Codification)
    * **One of the most important GAAP standards for nonprofits is Accounting for Contributions**
    * nonprofits must record the donor's intent for the gift in one of three categories:
      * Permanently restricted assets
      * Temporarily restricted assets
      * Unrestricted assets
    * Donors may sue nonprofits to have their gifts returned if they believe their intent for the gift was not honored
    * One complication related to accounting = _pass-through contributions_ ; when a nonprofit collects a donation to turn over to another organization to use, the donation is treated as a liability until it is paid to the other organization
    * GAAP requires nonprofits to report expenses in three categories:
      * program expenses related to service delivery
      * management and general expenses that support programs
      * fundraising expenses
    * some funders, such as the United Way, limit the percentage of total expenses that may be spent on management and general activities
  * _Accounting Internal Controls_
    * The difference between an error (for example, sloppy accounting) and fraud is that fraud is intentional, but an error is unintentional
    * Conditions that can increase opportunities for fraud include having weak internal accounting controls, not obtaining an independent audit, having poorly trained personnel, installing a new accounting or IT system, changing management organization and responsibilities, and being overdependent on one person in areas with opportunities for fraud
    * **The most fundamental accounting control is to separate accounting duties among two or more persons**
    * the person keeping the books should not be the person signing the checks.
    * check signer should not receive bank notifications and reconcile bank statement
    * Separating duties is more challenging in a small nonprofit
    * Besides separation of duties, these practices may reduce the likelihood of fraud:
      * background and credit checks on all workers who handle cash
      * positive ethical environment
      * board members who have no financial interests in the nonprofit’s affairs.
      * audit committee
      * whistle-blower protection
      * Educate workers on the consequences
      * internal financial controls
      * Watch tax payments carefully
      * annual audits
      * purchase fidelity insurance
* <b>Budgeting</b>
  * Producing a realistic budget
    * To be an effective tool, budgets need to be realistic, consistent with strategic objectives, flexible, and measurable
    * budget should be a team effort of the executive staff, program staff, and board of directors
    * should reflect the programs and activities that are expected or desired for the coming year
  * Estimating and Reviewing Revenues and Expenses
    * Some revenues are easy to estimate; others are more problematic.
    * Business plans for new and continuing earned income ventures should include financial projections that can be used for budgeting
    * budget calendar sets the timetable for preparing and adopting the budget.
    * For a smaller nonprofit, input for the budget may be more informal, and the individuals who coordinate the programs may be volunteers who are not expected to prepare a detailed program budget
    * A budget is simply a plan for the fiscal year. Very rarely are the final financial statements for the year an exact match
* <b>Banking Relations</b>
  * Periodically seeking banking services encourages banks to “sharpen their pencils” to reduce prices and offer more services
  * Even a small nonprofit should compare what different banks can provide and the banks’ fee structures
* <b>Borrowing</b>
  * For nonprofits with razor-thin reserves, short-term borrowing is commonplace
  * Some nonprofits choose to borrow from a board or staff member. This is not recommended as it creates conflicts of interest and may not be the best business deal
  * A nonprofit’s borrowing options include:
    * line of credit
    * loan
    * bond
    * lease
* <b>Financial Risk Management</b>
  * Financial risks may involve:
    * damage to property due to carelessness, fire, natural causes, or faulty mechanisms
    * lost property due to dishonest acts
    * loss of income or increased costs due to the malfunction of a revenue-producing facility
    * liability losses due to accidents
    * productivity losses due to health problems, addictions, or other performance barriers
  * A hold harmless clause in a contract transfers legal liability, holding the other party liable for a loss
  * Risk may be accepted and addressed through self-insurance or by an insurance policy deductible
* <b>Auditing and Financial Analysis</b>
  * Auditing
    * The financial audit produces the most comprehensive report for evaluating fiscal condition.
    * Audits are required for nonprofits receiving $500,000 or more in a single year in direct or pass-through federal funds
    * In 2005, 67 percent of nonprofits had an external audit conducted by an independent auditor, and 91 percent of these audited nonprofits had annual expenses over $500,000
    * The nonprofit’s key responsibility in an audit is to close the books and prepare the financial statements for the auditor.
    * The auditor will render one of four opinions:
      * an unqualified (“clean”) opinion that the financial statements conform to GAAP
      * a qualified opinion that the financial statements generally conform to GAAP, but with noted exceptions
      * a disclaimer opinion that refrains from expressing an opinion because of material (serious) departures from GAAP
      * an adverse opinion stating that the financial statements do not conform to GAAP
    * four less expensive but also thorough alternatives to an audit:
      * _member review_ - a board member with an accounting, auditing, or finance background reviews accounting practices
      * _compilation_ - auditor compiles financial information into a set of financial statements but does not verify
      * _auditor review_ - auditor renders no opinion on the financial statements but issues a letter stating whether the nonprofit has complied with GAAP
      * _agreed-upon procedure_ - auditor evaluates one or more of the nonprofit’s accounting procedures
  * Financial Analysis
    * can be helpful in determining whether new systems and strategies need to be developed
    * statements may be presented at board meetings to show the financial condition of the nonprofit
    * board should look for any unexplained differences from the normal patterns
    * four key financial statements:
      * Statement of Financial Position
      * Statement of Activities
      * Statement of Cash Flows
      * Statement of Functional Analysis
  * Financial Indicators and Ratios
    * To judge the value of the ratios and any resulting externally derived scores, board and staff need to apply more sophisticated and comprehensive views of the nonprofit’s financial condition
    * _program efficiency ratio_ - percentage of funds spent directly on program services
    * _fundraising efficiency ratio_ - percentage of donations going to the nonprofit
    * _unrestricted net assets ratio_ - measures a nonprofit’s cushion
    * _number of days of cash on hand_
    * _current ratio_ (current assets divided by current liabilities) - indicator of liquidity
    * _acid-test ratio_ (current assets minus inventories divided by current liabilities) - also called the _quick ratio_, measures the ability to meet short-term obligations
    * _days in accounts receivable ratio_ (accounts receivable multiplied by 365 and divided by operating revenue) - average number of days that accounts are receivable
  * Financial Literacy
    * Financial literacy is an important key to fulfillment of fiduciary duties. All nonprofit chief executive officers need a sound grounding in financial management
    * Board manuals and learning sessions at meetings can be used to help board members develop their financial literacy.
* Good financial management starts with competent staff and an informed board
* all nonprofits should make the time to review their areas of vulnerability, make decisions on how to handle their identified risks, and have a plan to access funds in an emergency
* all nonprofits should be prepared to be transparent and accountable in their financial management systems
