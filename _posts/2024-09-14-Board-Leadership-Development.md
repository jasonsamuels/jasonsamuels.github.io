In addition to the cohort program this semester, I'm also taking a one credit class on Board Leadership Development. Because I didn't have enough to do already, lololololol. Really, because I needed to take one more credit somewhere along this journey, and a chance to take a class taught by Kate Barr was too good to pass up.

Before... So here I am in class on another Saturday morning. The MPA cohort won't meet again until two weeks from now, but this class is one full Saturday plus three more two hour Friday sessions over the next few months. One of my cohort-mates is here too, but otherwise all new faces in this room.

After... Today was 100% what I hoped this class would be. My classmates are exceptional nonprofit and public sector leaders and the academic content is rigorous. It was also great to talk more with my MPA cohort mate over lunch, especially in context of one of the key lessons of the day being the importance of developing trust through relationship building.

The class discussion was rich. I especially appreciated the non-student nonprofit leaders who showed up. Hearing how everyone's perspectives and experiences bore out class concepts was illuminating. I spoke to my own experience a bit but tried to listen more.

The assignments for this class are one page reflection essays, which is awesome for me 'cause I'm just gonna turn in these blog posts.

Tomorrow will be a short weekend, then a full work week. My P&P team submittied our first assignment. I need to write my ALP articulation by tomorrow night. The first Qualitative Research assignment is due next week. Reading volume will pick up later this month, and they warned us October will be intense. I'm resisting the urge to stress out about it, but it's hard not to feel some pressure from all of the coming deadlines.
