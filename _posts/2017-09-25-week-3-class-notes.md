## Notes from Strategic Planning

* Reflections on last week's PennDOT case:
  * Importance of keeping an open mind
  * Thinking about a lot of options up front
  * tackle things in such a way that you can build success and build on success - order you do things is important
  * Shocked at just how bad things can get, though the backlash led to a strong mandate for change
* Always engage in strategic planning in a specific context. Be careful about how you generalize from one situation to another.
* Design principles ideas .. you engage in strategic planning to engage in changing a situation.
* Even more important than going step-by-step is thinking backward from where you need to be to where you are to figure out what it will take to succeed.
* Need to have a process that’s flexible enough to be able to change based on what we learn along the way.
* Strategic planning processes are divergent, convergent, partially-cumulative processes.
  * Divergent: what is our mission? Who are our stakeholders?
  * Convergent: converge on some of those ideas
  * Partially-cumulative: you take some of the ideas with you, but not everything. And you circle back to what you learn
* SP is a diversified, shared-power process. Makes divergence easy but convergence difficult
* Attention given to stakeholders is something that makes strategic planning unique
* You need to think about who needs to say yes, and what they care about
* The term stakeholder is intentionally broad, so you don’t leave out anyone who may be
* Every organization is an arena for competition and control of resources and output. Stakeholder analysis is a way of understanding the political landscape of a situation
* The key to success for a strategic planning process is satisfying the key stakeholders

## Notes from Strategic Human Resources Management

* Leaders really need to pursue who they’re about. Need to lead from who you are. Can’t try to be somebody else and be a leader. Need to start with yourself. And when you realize who you are you’ll be a better leader in your organization.
* The point is not to become a leader, point is to become yourself in order to make your vision manifest. You must withhold nothing, become the person you started out to be and enjoy the process of becoming.
* Think about leadership in lots of contexts. Everyone can be a leader with the characteristics you have within the right setting.
* Ambition is a choice
* Lead from your strengths and be who you are.
* Need to modify for the internal & external environment, and for the group member characteristics.
* You choose whether you’re going to have integrity as a leader. You choose the styles and values that define your leadership style.
* Unlike Myers-Briggs types, leadership competencies can be changed and improved upon
* Behavior is a by-product of the interplay of situation, responses, and innate preferences
* To call up on the best from others, you need to understand them
* “We all have biases. The challenge is to realize them and not turn them into prejudice.”
