### A Matrixed Approach to Designing IT Governance, Weill & Ross (2005)

* Without formal IT governance, individual managers are left to resolve isolated issues as they arise, and those individual actions can often be at odds with each other
* IT governance is a mystery to key decision makers at most companies
* Just one in three senior managers know how IT is governed
* When senior managers take the time to design, implement, and communicate IT governance processes, companies get more value from IT.
* Effective IT governance doesn't happen by accident
* senior management awareness of IT governance is the single best indicator of its effectiveness
* **IT governance can be assessed by evaluating how well it enables IT to deliver on four objectives: cost-effectiveness, asset utilization, business growth and business flexibility**
* high IT governance performance correlated with the achievement of other desired measures of success
* IT governance encompasses five major decision domains.
  * _IT principles_ comprise the high level decisions about the strategic role of IT
  * _IT architecture_ includes an integrated set of technical choices to guide the organization
  * _IT infrastructure_ consists of the centrally coordinated, shared IT services that provide the foundation for the enterprise's IT capability
  * _Business application needs_ are the business requirements for IT applications
  * _prioritization and investment decisions_ determine how much and where to invest in IT
* Each of these decision areas can be addressed at the corporate, business unit or functional level or some combination of the three
* first step in designing IT governance is to determine who should make and be held accountable for each decision area
* six archetypal approaches to IT decision making, ranging from highly centralized to highly decentralized:
  * _business monarchy_ - most centralized approach, senior business executive or a group of senior execs make all the IT-related decisions
  * _IT monarchy_ - decisions are made by an individual IT executive or a group of IT executives
  * _federal system_ - representatives of all the operating groups collaborate with the IT department
  * _IT duopoly_ - involves IT executives and a group of business leaders
  * _feudal system_ - business unit or process leaders make separate decisions
  * _anarchy_ - each individual user or small group pursues their own IT agenda
* Once the types of decisions and the archetypes for making those decisions are mapped out, a company must design and implement a coordinated set of governance mechanisms
* three kinds of governance mechanisms:
  * _Decision-making structures_
    * most visible IT governance mechanisms
    * Different archetypes rely on different decision-making structures
  * _Alignment processes_
    * management techniques for securing widespread and effective involvement in governance decisions and their implementation
  * _Formal communications_
    * variety of ways: general announcements, formal committees, one-on-one sessions, intranets, etc.
    * more communication generally means more effective governance
* Well-designed, well-understood and transparent mechanisms promote desirable IT behaviors and individual accountability
* There is no single best model of TT governance.
* effective IT governance should be evident in business-performance metrics
* Centralized Approaches and Profitability
  * The most profitable companies tend to be centralized in their approach to TT governance. Their strategies emphasize efficient operations
  * desirable for IT governance to encourage a high degree of standardization in the pursuit of low business costs
  * **Key mechanisms include executive committees for decision making, centralized processes for architecture compliance and exceptions, enterprise-wide IT investment decision processes, and formal post-implementation assessments of IT-related projects**
* Decentralized Approaches and Growth
  * The fastest-growing companies are focused on innovation and time to market
  * companies seek to maximize responsiveness to local customer needs and minimize constraints
  * Accordingly, they require few governance mechanisms, often relying only on an investment process that identifies high-priority strategic projects and manages risk.
* Hybrid Approaches and Asset Utilization
  * Companies seeking optimal asset utilization attempt to balance the contrasts between governance for profitability and governance for revenue growth and innovation
  * focus on using shared services to achieve either responsiveness to customers or economies or scale - or both
  * IT principles emphasize sharing and reuse of processes, systems, technologies and data
  * hybrid approach to governance, mixing elements of centralized and decentralized governance
  * typically rely on duopolies and federal governance design
* The hybrid approach is common, but it clearly demands a great deal of management attention
* Effective IT governance demands that senior managers define enterprise performance objectives and actively design governance to facilitate behavior that is consistent with those objectives.
* companies have mature business governance processes to use as a starting point in designing IT governance
* In order to use the framework effectively, management teams must first establish the context for IT governance
* means clarifying how the company will operate, how the company's structure will support its operations and what governance arrangements will elicit the desirable behaviors
* Governance arrangements generally transcend organizational structure and can be more stable than structure.
* IT governance design should encompass four steps:
  * _Identify the company's needs for synergy and autonomy_
    * Synergy-autonomy trade-offs force senior managers to make tough decisions and communicate those decisions throughout the enterprise
    * establishes the parameters for the design of IT governance
  * _Establish the role of organization structure_
    * By establishing organizational priorities for autonomy and synergy, companies can introduce organizational designs and incentive systems that reinforce their priorities
  * _Identify the desirable IT-related behaviors that fall outside the scope of organizational structure_
    * rather than restructuring each time priorities shift, new governance mechanisms can force new behaviors without requiring reorganization
    * governance mechanisms can provide organizational stability by demanding disciplined processes
    * governance itself appears to become more stable as companies learn good governance practices
    * Together, organizational structure and IT governance design can allow companies to achieve seemingly cont1jcting objectives
    * IT investment decision processes can direct business unit priorities toward enterprise priorities by approving only projects that support enterprise strategies, even if organizational structures place responsibility for accomplishing project outcomes on business unit managers
  * _Thoughtfully design IT governance on one page_
    * When the objectives of IT governance are clear, companies can design IT governance by outlining mechanisms
    * **Companies that have not been effective in using IT strategically should expect to invest in organizational learning**
* Effective IT governance certainly doesn't happen accidentally. But companies that have followed the steps enumerated above have had demonstrable success designing, communicating and refining IT that creates real business value in their enterprises

### Forget Strategy: Focus IT on your Operating Model, Ross (2005)

* Most companies try to maximize value from IT investments by aligning IT and IT-enabled business processes with business strategy. But business strategy is multi-faceted
* strategic priorities can shift  
* As a result, strategy rarely offers sufficiently clear direction for development of stable IT and business process capabilities
* IT is left to align with strategic initiatives after they're launched and becomes a persistent bottleneck
* To make IT a proactive—rather than reactive—force in creating business value, companies should define an _operating model_
  * an operating model is _the necessary level of business process integration and standardization for delivering goods and services to customers_
* By identifying integration and standardization requirements an operating model defines critical IT and business process capabilities
* two important choices in the design of their operations:
  * how standardized their business processes should be across operational units
  * how integrated their business processes should be across those units
* four operating models:
  * _Diversification_ (low standardization, low integration)
    * pursue different markets with different products and services, and benefit from local autonomy in deciding how to address customer demands
  * _Unification_ (high standardization, high integration)
    * pursues the need for reliability, predictability and low cost by standardizing business processes and sharing data across business units to create an end-to-end view of operations and a single face to the customer
  * _Coordination_ (low standardization, high integration)
    * creates a single face to its customers or a transparent supply chain without forcing specific process standards on its operating units
  * _Replication_ (high standardization, low integration)
    * perform tasks the same way using the same systems, although operating units rarely interact
* By identifying the intended level of business process integration and standardization, the operating model determines priorities for development of digital capabilities and thus IT investment
* Although most companies can identify processes fitting every operating model, they need to select a single operating model to guide management thinking and system implementation
* One way companies respond to conflicting demands is to adopt different operating models at different organizational levels
* strong preference across companies and industries for the Unification model
* Data collected at 103 companies in 2004
  * 63% targeting Unification
  * 9% targeting Diversification
  * 17% targeting Coordination
  * 11% targeting Replication
* appeal of the Unification model is that it provides a thick foundation of digital capabilities to leverage in future business initiatives
* requires a great deal of time, money and management focus
* (Coordination and Replication) require less time for building capabilities before companies can start re-using them
* each operating model creates opportunities—but also creates limitations.
* The operating model concept requires that management put a stake in the ground and declare which business processes will distinguish a company from its competitor
* not choosing an operating model is just as risky
* **In adopting an operating model a company benefits from a paradox: standardization leads to flexibility**
* an operating model provides needed direction for building a reusable foundation for business execution. IT becomes an asset instead of a bottleneck

### Building IT Infrastructure for Strategic Agility, Weill, Subramani, & Broadbent (2002)

* few choices more critical than deciding which IT investments will be needed for future strategic agility
* those choices can significantly enable or impede business initiatives
* investments by different business units are often made independently, often of a short term, catch up, or bleeding-edge nature, resulting in incompatible technologies
* Overinvesting in infrastructure leads to wasted resources, underinvesting translates into delays, rushed implementations, islands of automation, and limited sharing
* infrastructure investments are often shared across many applications, business initiatives and business units. But sharing requires negotiation
* Executives need a framework for making informed decisions about IT infrastructure
* **The key finding: ln leading enterprises, each type of strategic agility requires distinct patterns of IT-infrastructure capability. And any company that can determine the type of agility it will need for specific business initiatives is more likely to make sensible infrastructure investments**
* Once a company's infrastructure is in place, there is a potential payoff: Competitors need long lead times to emulate
* tailored, strategy-enabling infrastructure can be reused for many business initiatives
* Whether to place the IT infrastructure capability in individual business units or make it enterprise-wide is a strategic decision
* An integrated IT infrastructure combines the enterprise's shared IT capabilities into a platform for all business processes
* leading companies we studied tended not to establish their infrastructure through a few large one-time IT investments, but gradually, through incremental modular investments
* IT infrastructure is a collection of reliable, centrally coordinated services budgeted by senior managers and comprising both technical and human capability
* The services concept has advantages for the IT group, too, because infrastructure services remain relatively stable even when technical components change
* In analyzing the infrastructure services of the 89 enterprises in our study, we identified 70 different services in 10 clusters of IT-infrastructure services
* The first six clusters comprise the _physical_ layer:
  * Cluster 1: channel-management services
  * Cluster 2: security and risk-management services
  * Cluster 3: communication service
  * Cluster 4: data-management services
  * Cluster 5: application-infrastructure services
  * Cluster 6: IT-facilities-management service
* four clusters that represent management-oriented IT capabilities:
  * Cluster 7: IT-management services
  * Cluster 8: IT-architecture-and-standards service
  * Cluster 9: IT-education services
  * Cluster 10: IT R&D services.
* Strategic agility is defined by the set of business initiatives an enterprise can readily implement
* research demonstrates a significant correlation between strategic agility and IT-infrastructure capability
* **if managers can describe their desired strategic agility**, they then can identify the IT-infrastructure service clusters that need to be above the industry average - and thus **can create a distinctive competence**
* industry leadership in implementing IT initiatives requires high-capability IT infrastructure in all three realms of the value net and that high levels of competence are essential in every cluster but IT education
* integrated infrastructure needed for strategic agility does not have to be enterprise-wide
* Notably, there is a conflict inherent in data management. For internal and supply-side initiatives, data management is best provided locally, but for demand-side initiatives, data management is needed enterprise-wide
* B2B and B2C initiatives require different patterns of high-capability infrastructure both in terms of which clusters are key and whether they are enterprise-wide or local.
* B2B interactions, all high-capability-infrastructure clusters tend to he managed at the business-unit level.
* B2C, such capabilities are centrally coordinated, with the emphasis on uniformity across business units
* differences in infrastructure capabilities depending on whether a company was pursuing initiatives in new products or new markets
* new-product initiatives, R&D and channel-management clusters were mostly local
* new-market initiatives required enterprise-wide service clusters
* implementing different types of electronically based business initiatives requires different high-capability IT infrastructures
* Strategic agility requires time, money, leadership and focus — and an understanding of which distinct patterns of high-capability infrastructures are needed where
* Underinvesting reduces strategic agility and slows time to market
* infrastructure investments usually must be made before investments in business applications because doing both at the same time results in infrastructure fragmentation
* if the infrastructure is not used or is the wrong kind, a company is overinvesting and wasting resources
* **Successful enterprises get the infrastructure balance right because they make regular, systematic, modular and targeted investments in IT infrastructure on the basis of an overall strategic direction.**
* critical for the enterprise's most senior executives to understand which specific IT-infrastructure capabilities are needed for which kinds of initiatives

### Building Enterprise Alignment: A Case Study, Fonstad & Subramani (2009)

Executive Summary
* IT-business alignment in multi-business-unit firms that have a federated IT structure involves two types of alignment—local alignment and enterprise alignment
* Local alignment efforts focus on serving the technology needs of an individual business unit and creating business value
* Enterprise alignment efforts involve coordinating potential economies and efficiencies across business unit
* three components to be key to successful enterprise alignment:
  * Building the capabilities of the shared IT services group so it can provide infrastructure services
  * Introducing opportunities for IT and business managers to collaborate
  * Creating new mechanisms for business unit leaders to be better informed about IT investment trade-offs and corporate IT leaders to be better informed about the business value of specific shared services

Federated IT requires both local and enterprise alignment
* We define alignment as the process by which those responsible for managing information technology (IT) and stakeholders from the rest of a firm work together to achieve long-term business value
* multi-business-unit firms that have a federated IT structure require two forms of alignment: local and enterprise
* Although local and enterprise alignment share common elements, they differ significantly in the overall objectives of the working relationship metrics for success, the participants who need to be involved, the key interdependencies that participants manage, and the tools they draw on
* Firms that focus solely on local alignment to enable business responsiveness risk creating “IT infrastructure spaghetti”
* uncoordinated islands jeopardize both business-unit and enterprise-wide interests.
* To build enterprise alignment, IT and business managers must learn to work together
*  lack of understanding of IT infrastructure investment causes problems in firms where IT is integral to business
operations
* IT and business managers had worked together to build enterprise alignment by developing three components:
  * Both the infrastructure group and the application development group strengthened their internal IT capabilities
  * IT leaders created short-term and long-term engagement opportunities for IT and business stakeholder groups to collaborate
  * IT and business participants created decision making tools for managing interdependencies
* <b>Lessons learned</b>
  * Lesson 1: In firms with a federated IT structure, local alignment is insufficient; enterprise alignment is needed as well.
  * Lesson 2: Manage the interdependencies between applications and IT infrastructure.
* <b>Recommendations</b>
  * _Strengthening Internal IT Capabilities_
    * Include operations and maintenance costs in project proposals
    * Build project management capabilities
    * Create a relationship management group
    * Define services by their business role
  * _Enhancing Engagement Opportunities_
    * Introduce a short-term project with a clear objective to rally collaboration between key stakeholders.
    * Assign clear roles and responsibilities for achieving both local and enterprise-wide objectives.
    * Hold key decision makers accountable over the long-term by having them participate in regular meetings where the decision process and trade-offs are transparent.
  * _Improving Coordination of Interdependencies_
    * Produce tools that relate costs and benefits managed within business units to costs and benefits managed enterprise-wide.
    * Create options that enable business-unit decision makers to share responsibility for managing trade-offs.
* Enterprise alignment enables IT and business stakeholder groups to take greater control of shared resources and achieve synergies that no single IT unit can achieve on its own.

### Teaming Up to Crack Innovation & Enterprise Integration, Cash, Earl, & Morison (2008)

* Successful innovation often depends on the ability to coordinate efforts across organizational boundaries because innovations reach sufficient scale and impact only when integrated into the larger operations
* CEOs today are asking their CIOs and IT organizations to play bigger roles in the growth agenda by providing the tools for collaborative innovation
* the work involves sometimes daunting challenges because business innovation and integration have something else in common – both are still “unnatural acts” in most large corporations. Businesses are better at stifling innovation than at capitalizing on it. The larger and more complex the organization, the stronger the status quo can be
* **Specifically, we recommend the formation of two agencies:**
  * A **distributed innovation group (DIG)**, which doesn’t “do” innovation but rather fosters and channels it.
  * An **enterprise integration group (EIG)**, dedicated to the horizontal integration of the corporation
* Sometimes these groups report to the CIO; sometimes they do not. Either way, they are home to some of the corporation’s most capable and experienced IT professionals
* The common recipe for increasing innovation predominantly focuses on generating and vetting new ideas. But that’s not the problem: Large corporations generate plenty of ideas. The problem is harvesting them, allocating the company’s vast resources to them, and managing their development in a coordinated and efficient way
* The DIG deploys entrepreneurial analysts to promote innovation in a variety of ways:
  * Scouting for ideas with potential for the company
  * Constantly scanning the external environment
  * Facilitating participation in “ideagoras” – the online market places for problem solving
  * Acting as a center of innovation expertise that advises business units on managing portfolios of innovation initiative
  * Publicizing promising innovations and their progress toward implementation
  * Serving as a temporary home for developing pilots or prototypes of promising innovations
* The DIG should be staffed with business-IT hybrids – people with sufficient depth in specific business processes to sharply focus innovation in those areas
  * members should be widely dispersed across the enterprise
  * full-time agents of innovation, with no other day job.
  * they must be networked together
  * must be adaptable, keeping its most skilled analysts deployed where the innovation action is
* To whom should the DIG report? If innovation is high enough on the corporate agenda, it should answer to the CEO. Otherwise, it might report to the R&D executive or perhaps to a business-unit or process executive
* We see many variations on the DIG theme
* Three types of IT capabilities are especially important to distributed innovation:
  * Up-to-date understanding of emerging technologies and insight into trends, especially how technologies are converging to create radically new possibilities
  * Mastery of iterative and experimental application development methods, including the creation of robust business simulation
  * Facility with information dissemination and collaboration technologies
* the rest of the organization has three key innovation duties:
  * Providing technology tools and infrastructure to support innovation initiatives.
  * Providing skilled technical people for all substantial innovation initiatives
  * Rapidly incorporating the new innovation’s information, systems, technology, and business logic into the corporate infrastructure
* requires a corporate mechanism that can overcome traditional silo resistance through its mandate and capabilities. That’s the work of an enterprise integration group.
* An effective EIG:
  * Manages the corporate portfolio of integration activities and initiatives
  * Serves as the corporation’s center of expertise in process management and improvement, large-project management, and program and portfolio management
  * Contributes staff to major business integration initiatives – **sometimes leaders, always coaches.**
  * Is responsible for enterprise architecture – the overall configuration and managed evolution of the company’s business processes, information, and technology
  * Anticipates how operations might work in a more integrated fashion in the future and what management changes that might require
* One of the biggest challenges in forming an EIG may be gathering the right staff. You need people with a broad understanding of every piece of the business who can look at the enterprise systemically
* You also need people with experience in areas like enterprise-system implementation and information architecture
* You need people with pragmatic coaching skills, who can guide business partners
* you need people with very strong relationship-building skills, because business integration demands more than just a consensus about how things should work; it demands a commitment to operate differently
* If horizontal integration is a sufficiently urgent strategic imperative, the EIG should report to the CEO. More commonly, it reports to the COO
* <b>What Integration Capabilities Do You Need?</b>
  * Ask yourself to what extent your organization has already mastered these capabilities, then configure your EIG to fill in the gaps
    * Governance
    * Relationship Management
    * Program Management
    * Architecture
    * Process Skills
    * Change Leadership
* <b>Three Technology Management Imperative</b>
  * success demands a comprehensive IT management strategy and infrastructure consisting of three elements:
    * Business Platform
    * Outside Services
    * Web 2.0   (ed. note - _oh, 2008_)
* IT organizations almost invariably have much more experience with enterprise integration than with distributed innovation
* IT people have intimate knowledge of the workings of the company, including the idiosyncrasies and hidden interdependencies between processes and data
* Their work requires them to take a systemic view of business-information and process flows
* “The executive team knows how business integration is supposed to work, but IT sees the detail level and can leverage that understanding.”
* Six sets of skills are central to the work of an EIG. The first five are often found in IT organizations. The **sixth is rarer – and needs to be cherished and nurtured**:
  * Familiarity with the concepts and methods of business process design and improvement
  * Experience with cross-functional systems implementation
  * Competence in analyzing architecture
  * Expertise in information management
  * Experience with program management
  * **A talent for relationship management**
* In equal measure, DIG and EIG need to connect and build relationships with internal change agents and with external partners and stakeholders
* Most members of both groups must be trilingual – fluent in the language of business, able to understand and translate the language of IT, and at ease with the natural language of sociability
* They also need to know the organization – how it works, who the movers and shakers are, and whom to ask for help in finding solutions
* These are rare beings, and competition for their services will be high
* neither the DIG nor the EIG can be very large – nor do they need to be
* Ideally, the members of these two groups will be drawn from the business and after a few years will return to operational roles
* Despite their commonalities, the two units operate in different spheres.
  * The DIG enables the corporation to devise new ways to operate; the EIG enables the corporation to coordinate its operations to improve performance
  * The DIG creates new business variations; the EIG takes yesterday’s new variations and folds them into the operating model of the enterprise
  * The DIG injects novelty and variety; the EIG battles against fragmentation
* together they enable the corporation to evolve. And the company pursuing growth must excel at both
