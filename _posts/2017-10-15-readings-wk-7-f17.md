## Strategic Planning (SP)

### Lessons We Don't Learn, Donahue and Tuohy (2006)

* Case study of a February 2006 White House report on lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina.
* Lessons called out in briefing concerned planning, resource management, evacuation, situational awareness, communications, and coordination
* No one in the emergency response community was surprised, because we identify the same lessons again and again, incident after incident
* we repeatedly confront command and control issues in large incidents, but somehow we fail to learn
* The central concerns of this paper are why that is so and how we can improve, targeting six research questions:
  1. Is it true that lessons recur?
  2. What lessons are persistently identified?
  3. Why do these lessons continue to be identified as important?
  4. Why are these lessons so hard to learn? (That is, why do agencies have difficulty devising and implementing corrective actions once lessons are identified?)
  5. How do lessons-learned processes work?
  6. How can they be improved?
* by explicitly identifying persistent challenges, responders may be better attuned to challenges and more able to address them in their processes
* by better understanding why challenges remain unresolved, responders may be able to adapt
* Various mechanisms for sharing experience have emerged. Most processes involve some version of three core components:
  1. Evaluating an incident
  2. Identifying lessons
  3. Learning
* **while review of incidents and the identification of lessons are more readily accomplished, true learning is much more difficult**
* Despite the disparity of the reports we reviewed, we found a striking consistency in major categories of lessons identified. Five main areas:
  1. command
  2. communications
  3. planning
  4. resource management
  5. public relations
* By using the term “command and control,” we do not mean to suggest that structures are unitary, rigid, or static. Successful management requires collaboration, flexibility, and adaptability across multiple diverse actors.
* What accounts for command problems? Agencies lack the commitment to coordinate. At best, they're unaware of what others are doing. At worst, they're unwilling to cooperate.
* Primary mechanism for resolving resource-allocation struggles, the Emergency Operations Center (EOC), is often ineffective. Delegates sent to EOCs are usually liaisons who lack decision-making authority. Turf battles rage.
* Incident Command Systems (ICS) are in common use but not understood and implemented in a consistet manner. “Everyone agrees we need ICS, but we don’t share one system.”
* communications isn’t entirely (or even fundamentally) a technology problem
* **technology is only an enabler; communicating requires that people are willing to share information with each other. "We dump millions into hardware, but don’t think about systems."**
* The most fundamental problem to plague planning processes is a lack of commitment to plans across agencies and jurisdictions.
* Plans are often developed by mid-level managers. Senior managers and political officials may have the plan on their shelves, but get no formal training on what is in it or how to use it. Similarly, plans are not disseminated to supervisors or training academies.
* Resources must be obtained rapidly when a disaster occur. Normal resource acquisition systems are too slow and are not designed to obtain large amounts of supplies rapidly.
* well-meaning volunteers add a significant management burden to already over-taxed incident managers
* public relations challenge - when agencies fail to use a common message, do not control the message carefully, the pressure to get information out quickly undermines accuracy
* It should be possible to solve at least some of these problems once and for all. Challenges to this proposition in five general areas:
  * <b>Motivation for Change</b>
    * Organizational change is notoriously difficult, but particular challenges attend change in the emergency response arena.
    * Even following a major event, it is hard to sustain a commitment to change long enough to accomplish it.
    * Another impediment is the episodic nature of events. Happens infrequently in any given location, but consistently in the nation as a whole. To improve response overall emergency response community has to be willing to learn from each other. Calls for organizations to think of their experiences collectively.
    * Pressure for change from within the discipline does not have the same force as external scrutiny
    * Thinking about learning and change in a single agency or discipline faces substantial barriers. Doing this work collectively is even harder
  * <b>Review and Reporting Process</b>
    * Assuming that an agency is open to learning and change, the learning process can be thought of as beginning with the identification of lessons
    * After Action Reports (AARs) typically focus on what went wrong, but chiefs want to know what they can do that is right
    * Value of reports is often undermined because they're not distributed effectively. As a result, adoption of new practices is haphazard
  * <b>Learning and Teaching</b>
    * Failure to learn is due, in part, to a lack of systems to identify and disseminate lessons.
    * Simplistically, the lesson learning and change process iterates through the following steps:
      * Identify the lesson
      * recognize the causal process
      * devise a new operational process
      * practice the new process
      * embed/institutionalize and sustain the new process
    * agencies tend to consider individual incidents and particular lessons in isolation, rather than as systems or broad patterns of behavior.
    * practice is required to inculcate new behavior.
    * feedback after implementing new practices is typically informal and passive; it comes from simply noticing improvement, rather than actively testing for it.
  * <b>Exercising</b>
    * Perhaps the key mechanism for testing, practicing, refining, and inculcating new lessons-derived behaviors is exercising.
    * One design problem is striking the right balance between the known and the unknown.
    * Another design problem is a lack of realism
    * A major impediment is fear of failure
      * "People don’t come to exercises because they’re afraid they’ll be tested, that they’ll make mistakes, and that they’ll be embarrassed"
      * "We don’t train people how to operate first and then test them afterwards. Instead, we throw them in blind, and then tear them apart afterwards."
    * important imbalances in exercise goals and the content of exercise scenarios
    * uneven participation means that agencies miss the opportunity to build strong, trusting relationship
  * <b>Resource Constraints</b>
    * Commitment to learning is wasted if resources are not available to support the process.
    * investments in basic capacity are not as marketable – as “sexy” – as equipment for combating terrorism.
* **Fundamental challenge is that it takes long-term resource commitment and organizational discipline to solve recurring problems.**
* Recommendations:
  * <b>need to radically improve the way we train and exercise</b>
    * exercises must be recast as learning activities targeted at improving performance
    * exercise planning should follow the military-style crawl - walk - run structure
    * We must find a way to introduce the chaos and common failures likely in a real event into state, regional, and local exercises
    * To support lessons-focused planning, agencies must establish and follow a requirement to document events and lessons learned immediately post-operation. Adopting a standard format for this process would make it easier
  * <b>need a comprehensive, nationwide capability to gather and validate the information we learn</b>
    * Learning lessons depends on the development of a robust analytical capability
    * **Tools such as databases with smart search engines, electronic update bulletins, and web-based training, should be employed so that responders could easily find information relevant to their missions, disciplines, service responsibilities, and hazard environments**
      * Note: parallels here to [Intellipedia](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/03/the-governments-secret-wiki-for-intelligence/518508/)
    * A crucial concern when developing an effective lessons analysis institute is liability. Integrity requires that those who report be protected from retribution
  * <b>need incentives to institutionalize lessons-learning processes</b>
    * To achieve broad consistency, important to promote a regional commitment to identifying problems and adopting best practices
* ability to capitalize on experience and improve capacity is ever more important
* **Enduring change needs to address the structure, system, and culture of an organization**
* As a practical matter, the main problem with lesson learning can be seen as a lack of will and commitment, rather than a lack of ability.
* most big lessons are inter-agency lessons, requiring learning within and across agencies
* Prevention is an important (and oft-ignored) goal. Suggests two things:
  1. those who prepare reports often forego the opportunity to comment on how to avoid problems altogether
  2. further research is warranted to understand learning in the context of prevention
* helping organizations navigate the complexities of lessons learning should be informed by the substantial academic literature that has developed around this issue.
