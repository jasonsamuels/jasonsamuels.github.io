### Managing Nonprofit Organizations, Tschirhart and Bielefeld (2012)

#### Chapter 1 - Understanding Nonprofit Organizations
* Nonprofit organizations have a distinct mandate to be good stewards of the resources they receive
* this is a book about nonprofit leadership and management
* importance of context becomes clear when we look at the competencies proposed in November 2011 for nonprofit managers and leaders by the Non-Profit Management Education Section of NASPAA (National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration)
  1. history, values, ethics, and philosophies of nonprofit organizations, and the need for transparency in nonprofit management practices to maintain the public trust
  2. current legal frameworks for operating a nonprofit organization, and the process of forming an incorporated nonprofit organization
  3. fundamental principles and concepts of fiscal management, and the ethical imperative to be a good steward
  4. leadership challenges of the sector as they relate to the strategic management of nonprofit organizations
  5. human resource and volunteer management principles
  6. standards for accountability, performance measurement, and program evaluation, and performance measurement techniques
* Our comprehensive approach to excelling at managing and leading nonprofits is built around these competency and curriculum guidelines
* This book is not about management and leadership in general; it is about management and leadership _in the nonprofit sector_
* Alternative terms used for the nonprofit sector: independent sector, third sector, not-for-profit sector, charitable sector, philanthropic sector, civil society sector, tax-exempt sector, social sector, Outside the United States: nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society organizations
* <b>Diversity in the Nonprofit Sector</b>
  * Of the close to 1.6 million registered nonprofits in the United States, the majority are _public charities_, about 1 million.
  * About 100,000 are classified as _private foundations_
  * Over 500,000 tax-exempt organizations are classified as other types of nonprofits, such as chambers of commerce, fraternal organizations, social and recreational clubs, and business leagues
* Overall in 2009, registered nonprofits in all Internal Revenue Service (IRS) categories accounted for 9 percent of the wages and salaries paid in the United States
* There is no precise, accurate count of the number of organizations making up the U.S. nonprofit sector. The U.S. government does not require churches and other religious places of worship to register
* One estimate is that there are close to 280,000 religious congregations in the country
* There are also many grassroots organizations that are not legally incorporated and thus left uncounted
* David Horton Smith suggests that the nonprofit sector also contains what he refers to as deviant nonprofits, such as gangs, cults, covens, and quasi-underground organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan. These organizations operate outside normal conventions and are not legally recognized or tax exempt
* In the early history of the United States, voluntary action was the primary
way things got done in communities
* Nonprofits often function in areas where markets are lacking, such as the provision of food and shelter to those without money to pay for them
* nonprofits provide services that government, with its reliance on voter mandates, cannot
* nonprofits contribute to the establishment of social capital and the solidarity of American society, helping individuals to form bonds of trust and reciprocity with others
* Between September of 2009 and September of 2010, 26.3 percent of Americans over sixteen years of age volunteered through or for a nonprofit
* In 2010, nonprofit organizations received $290.9 billion in charitable contributions (of which $211.8 billion came from individuals)
* In 2009, the nonprofit sector’s share of the gross domestic product (GDP) was 5.4 percent
* In that year, public charities reported over $1.41 trillion in revenues and held $2.56 trillion in total assets.
* One of the most important challenges is to keep the mission in mind in all decision making
* Other challenges:
  * fiscal difficulties, some starting with government cutbacks in the 1980s in areas where nonprofits were active
  * Government assistance has become more targeted with stricter requirements
  * growing competition as more for-profits move into areas traditionally served by nonprofits
  * rise of B corporations
  * under pressure from funders who are demanding more evidence in evaluation
  * legitimacy of the nonprofit sector has been challenged on a number of fronts
* As this short summary of challenges illustrates, today’s nonprofit leaders must navigate turbulent waters in the pursuit of their organization’s mission

#### Chapter 3 - Founding Nonprofits and the Business Case
* Nonprofits, unlike biological entities, do not always have a clear birth date. An organization may receive legal recognition years after it began to serve the public.
* A founder may imprint norms and values that are hard to change, even after that founder leaves
* Over time the founder may actually harm the long-term health of the organization because of his or her central role and inability to give up control, sometimes known as _founder's syndrome_
* new nonprofits shape the collaborative and competitive environment around them, entrants may be an _innovator organization_ or a _reproducer_
* Organizations can be founded in a number of ways - individual entrepreneur, legislative action, spun off from a larger parent org, federated associations that set up chapters or affiliates
* Some organizational transformations are so profound and radical that it can appear that one organization died and a fundamentally new one was born,
* The term social entrepreneurship became popular in the 1980s. It refers to the creation of products, organizations, and practices that yield and sustain social benefits
* a social entrepreneur can be any individual, group, network, organization, or alliance of organizations that seeks large-scale change through pattern-breaking ideas
* Social entrepreneurs can learn from their purely profit-seeking business counterparts (commercial entrepreneurs) by adapting Sahlman’s PCDO model: _people, context, deal, opportunity_
* **overlap of _people and capital_ with _opportunity_ create a _social value proposition_ in an environmental context of tax, regulatory, sociocultural, demographic, political, and macroeconomic influences**
* <b>People and capital</b>
  * The social entrepreneurship model emphasizes the people who actively participate in the venture
  * Economic self-interest is likely to play less of a role in social entrepreneurship than in commercial entrepreneurship
  * One of the newest options for capital for some social entrepreneurs is social impact bonds
* <b>Context</b>
  * Contextual elements outside the control of the entrepreneur infl uence success or failure
  * Commercial and social entrepreneurship ventures may be subject to different regulatory, fi nancing, tax, sociopolitical, and other infl uences
* <b>Social Value Proposition</b>
  * A project’s or organization’s social value proposition addresses the reasons why individuals will choose to be involved in a particular effort over other alternatives
  * The social value proposition typically speaks to fundamental values that the people involved in an enterprise’s transactions hold dear
* <b>Opportunity</b>
  * For a social entrepreneurship enterprise to be successful, enough individuals need to believe that it has a chance
  * Social entrepreneurs identify something they can do that others are not doing because it is not viable within existing commercial markets
* Consideration of the differences between social entrepreneurship and commercial entrepreneurship:
  * Centrality of social value
  * Organization and environmental alignment
  * Organizational boundaries
  * Cooperation
* Each nonprofit’s founding story is unique
* The idea for a new nonprofit organization can be assessed on three dimensions:
  * Social value potentially
  * Market potential
  * Sustainability potential
* The business plan differs from the strategic plan in its purpose and content. The strategic plan explains how an organization will achieve its objectives over a specified period of time.
* Business plans do not need to be long, elaborate documents. They should concisely and clearly state what business the nonprofit is in and the social value proposition.
* Perhaps the most important elements of the business plan are the vision and mission statements
  * The vision statement expresses a nonprofit’s ultimate goal
  * The mission statement should convey the nonprofit’s essential purpose, approach, and values, distinguishing it from other organizations
* There are many reasons to formally establish a nonprofit. Once formalized, it takes on an identity beyond that of its founders.
* One of the first options is whether to set up the nonprofit as an _unincorporated association_, _charitable trust_, or _nonprofit corporation_
* Nonprofit corporations may be either _public benefit_ organizations or _mutual benefit_ organizations
* The appeal of becoming a 501(c)(3) organization is that the nonprofit gains increased receptivity to appeals for support, tax deductibility for donors, eligibility for low-cost mailing permits, exemption from some taxes, ability to apply for gambling permits in some states, eligibility for government and foundation contracts and grants, and discounts from some businesses
* once established as a 501(c)(3) organization, the nonprofit is not allowed to engage in political campaigning, is subject to limits on lobbying and unrelated business activity, must ensure that social activities for participants are insubstantial if they are unrelated to its mission, and must also ensure that no excess benefits or inurements go to staff or board members
* The (c)(3) classification is not available to all nonprofits. Some entrepreneurs who wish their organizations to engage heavily in advocacy choose to pursue a 501(c)(4) rather than a 501(c)(3) classification
* Once the founder decides what legal form to pursue, an application can be made to the federal government for a _definitive ruling_, based on support the organization has received to date, or an _advance ruling_, based on support the organization will receive during its first five tax years\
* At the state level it is necessary to prepare and submit articles of incorporation
* After their nonprofit’s formal incorporation, founders need to have the mindset that the nonprofit is no longer their organization. It exists to serve a public purpose.
* Due to the efforts of social entrepreneurs, innovative approaches are continually being tested to address social problems that cannot viably be addressed by commercial markets.
* Whether a nonprofit emerges as a spin-off, subsidiary, or franchise or is established outside of an existing organization, its social value proposition will likely frame its fundamental approach and the types of supporters it can attract

#### Chapter 4 - Organizational structure
* A nonprofit’s structure is designed and created during the founding of the organization and then evolves, or is reorganized, continuously from that point on
* many dimensions of structure that affect how a nonprofit’s work gets done
* structure provides a way for organizations to meet two confl icting needs—the need to differentiate and the need to integrate
* In any but the smallest organizations with
the simplest output, the operation and work of an organization needs to be broken
up into separate tasks and functions. This is the organization’s division of labor
* organizational structure supports the production of outputs and achievement of organizational goals, minimizes or at least regulates the influence of individual variation on the organization, and provides the setting within which power is exercised
* Elements of organizations
  * environment
  * strategy
  * work and technology
  * formal organization
  * informal organization
  * people
* Dimensions of structure
  * formalization
  * complexity
  * centralization
  * specialization
  * standardization
  * Professionalism
  * hierarchy of authority
* Two types of internal management structures:
  * _mechanistic_ structures - more formalized and centralized, most decision making occurs at the top
  * _organic_ structures - less rigid and more flexible, fewer rules and more reliance on informal adoption, decisions made at lower levels with authority more dispersed
* **Many nonprofits exemplify the organic structure type because it appeals to values regarding the desirability of shared power, permeable organizational boundaries to facilitate collaboration, easy movement of members into and out of the organization, and an ability to be innovative and to mobilize quickly to address needs.**
* primary incentives for participating in the organization are intrinsic (doing something that fits one’s values and preferred social benefits), and extrinsic incentives (material benefits such as financial compensation) are secondary
* Common organizational configurations:
  * In a _functional structure_ activities are grouped together into units or departments by types of work skills and tasks—common functions such as fundraising
  * In a _divisional structure_ unit grouping is based not on functions but on organizational outputs or products
    * allows for decentralized decision making at the divisional level, freeing the top level of the organization to concentrate on overall decision making
  * Principle in a _geographical structure_ is to organize in terms of the location of the organization’s users or customers
  * A _matrix structure_ simultaneously uses aspects of both the functional and divisional structures.
  * an emerging form termed the _virtual network structure_ extends the concept of horizontal coordination and collaboration beyond the boundaries of the traditional organization.
    * characterized by the outsourcing, or contracting, of some of an organization’s functions or activities
* **information needs are a function of three dimensions of technology: complexity, uncertainty, and interdependence**
  * complexity is a function of the number of different items or elements that must be dealt with simultaneously in task accomplishment
  * Uncertainty refers to the variability of the items or elements on which work is performed
  * Interdependency is the extent to which items or elements on which work is performed or the work processes themselves are interrelated
    * _pooled interdependence_ staff from multiple departments need to work together as a team
    * _sequential interdependence_ someone must first secure one thing before another can be arranged
    * _reciprocal interdependence_, with units posing critical contingencies for each other that have to be resolved before action can be taken
  * In addition, organizational information needs have been linked to organizational
 environments and strategy
  * When information flow in a nonprofit is inadequate, a number of problems can arise.
  * A nonprofit’s structure is key to proper information flow. **The design challenge is to create structures that match the demands for information processing.** Information needs to flow horizontally as well as vertically through an organization in order to link employees, work units, and organizational levels.
    * _Vertical linkages_ can be used to coordinate activities between the various levels of a nonprofit and are primarily used for control. They ensure that lower levels of the nonprofit are aligned with goals set at higher levels and higher levels are informed of the activities of lower levels.
    * _Horizontal linkages_ can be used to ensure coordination between units at the same level of a nonprofit, such as divisions or departments within a division
* Organizations, including nonprofits, seek to be rational and to design their structures for efficiency and effectiveness. Organizational design, however, is a far from simple process with predictable outcomes
* The strategic choices organizations make are influenced by bounded rationality and the politics of the decision-making process. Organizational choices are made by *dominant coalitions*
  * The power of a coalition comes from combining the power held by the various parties in the coalition. The power of a dominant coalition is greater than that of other coalitions in the organization.
* _National culture_ will also influence organizational structure. Organizations are located in national cultural contexts, and organizational cultures will be a reflection of the larger culture
* _Organizational culture_ is the set of key values, beliefs, understandings, and norms shared by organizational participant
* The consequences of inattention to structural needs or inappropriate structural design can, however, be quite serious. A number of symptoms of structural deficiency have been identified:
 * Decision making is delayed or lacking in quality
 * The organization does not respond innovatively to a changing environment
 * Employee performance declines and goals are not being met
 * Too much conflict is evident
* Nonprofit organizational structure is both a consequence and a cause. It is a consequence of the nonprofit’s external context as well as its work processes and strategy. In turn structure influences many of the internal features of the nonprofit
* important to remember that strategy formulation process, as well as the others, are intimately interrelated with structure

### National Council of Nonprofits Fast Facts about the Nonprofit Sector (2017)
* Nonprofit organizations employed more than 10.6% of the workforce in 2013
* nonprofit sector contributed $634 billion in wages and salaries, 8.9% of all wages and salaries paid in the United States in 2013.
* nonprofit sector contributed an estimated $937.7 billion to the US economy in 2014, 5.4 percent of the country’s gross domestic product
* In Dec 2016 there were 1,202,719 public charities and private foundations
* Governments at all levels paid $130 billion to nonprofit organizations for services in 2014
* About 62.6 million people, or 24.9% of Americans age 16 and older, volunteered through or for a nonprofit organization at least once between September 2014 and September 2015
* estimated value of volunteer time for 2016 is $24.14 per hour, equaling an estimated $1.5 trillion.

### Minnesota Council of Nonprofits Nonprofit Economy Report (2016)
* From 2007 to 2016, the number of nonprofit employees grew in every single year and by 15 percent in total.
* helpful to separate hospitals, colleges and universities to better understand how the nonprofit sector has fared
* Between 2007 and 2016, nonprofit employment outside of hospitals and higher education grew an average of two percent per year
* The overall number of nonprofit employers in Minnesota has fallen by 17 percent over the last ten years, to fewer than 3,300 employers in 2016
* number of nonprofit locations has also been falling, 7 percent decline in the past five years
* Over time, nonprofit average annual wages have been closing the gap with average annual wages for for-profit and government employees.
  * In 2003, average wages in nonprofit sector were 12 percent below for-profit
  * By 2016, with hospitals and higher education included, nonprofit wages for the first time passed for-profit wages
  * Without hospitals and higher education institutions, the wage gap between the nonprofit sector and the for-profit sector remains seven percent below for-profit and three percent below government sector
* Average annual wages in nonprofit sector are highest in the health care industry, lowest for vocational rehabilitation services, child care providers and civic organizations
* a different picture emerges when comparing median wages within the same activity area. Nonprofit median wages compare more favorably, and are often higher than for-profit wages, in areas such as arts and entertainment, health care, individual and family services, child care and community services

### Salamon et al. What do Nonprofits Stand For? (2012)
* Nonprofits face significant loss of market share in a number of traditional nonprofit fields
* increasingly competitive environment
* as discussed in _The State of Nonprofit America_ by Lester Salamon, powerful impulses pull organizations simultaneously in different directions
  * voluntaristic past
  * greater Professionalism
  * expanded civic activism
  * deeper engagement with commercialism
* Salmon identifies three alternative courses the nonprofit sector can take in response
* consensus about what core values are poses an enormous challenge
* Two key findings emerged from this survey:
  * despite their diversity, this broad group of U.S. nonprofits is in basic agreement about the attributes that comprise the nonprofit sector’s core values
  * key stakeholders in government, the media, and the general public do not seem to understand these core values
* seven features commonly associated with the nonprofit sector
  * being productive
  * effective
  * enriching
  * empowering
  * responsive
  * reliable
  * caring
* over 50 percent of respondents said that neither the general public nor government officials have a solid grasp of the nonprofit sector’s special qualities
* over a third of respondents that both the media and organizational funders are also missing this information
* **problem cannot be blamed on these external barriers alone. Fully 62 percent of respondents acknowledged that the nonprofit sector does a poor job of articulating its special qualities**
* survey reveals significant difficulties in manifesting these attributes and conveying them to key target audiences.
  * the sector's role in empowering and mobilizing citizens seems to be attracting somewhat less vigorous endorsement from sector organizations
  * Sector leaders seem less certain about the productiveness of their efforts
  * Serious doubts exist about the success with which the sector is articulating and communicating its core values,
  * this is a problem that needs to be addressed for the sector to survive

### Willets What is a Non-Governmental Organization?
* The term "non-governmental organization" (NGO) came into currency in 1945, because of the need for the UN to differentiate in its charter between participation rights
* At the UN, virtually all types of private bodies can be recognized as NGOs
* Structures of NGOs vary considerably
* NGOs are components of social movements
* There is no generally accepted definition of an NGO, but some fundamental features:
  * independent from the direct control of any government
  * not constituted as a political party
  * non-profit-making
  * not a criminal group, in particular non-violent
  * never constituted as a govenment bureaucracy, a party, a company, a criminal organization, or a guerilla group
* For the purpose of this article, define NGO as an independent voluntary association of people acting together on a continuous basis, for some common purpose, other than achieving government office, making money or illegal activities
* Distinction between interest groups and pressure groups or between lobbies and private voluntary organizations has no analytical value
* The most difficult question about the interdependence of NGOs is whether they come under governmental influence
* In more authoritarian societies, NGOs may find it very difficult to act independently
* **There is widespread prejudice that government funding leads to government control**
* NGOs may appear to be independent, when they design their own programs, but government influence can arise indirectly
* variety of ways in which NGOs are structured
  * classic model is a _membership organization_, co-ordinated in a geographically-defined hierarchy
  * a minority of NGOs conform to the model of a _global democratic hierarchy_, in which any person may become a member
  * third variant is a _religious organization_
* Once NGOs decide to influence public policy, they organize, in broad coalitions, specifically for this purpose
* advent of email and the internet in the 1990s meant the cost s of running a network dropped substantially
* number of networks increased dramatically and they no longer needed any formal structure
* impact of technological change should not be exaggerated. Most effective modern networks still derive their impact from being coalitions of well-organized NGOs. Although communications costs are now minimal, it is still essential to have sufficient resources at the center
* A variant of the global network is a global caucus
* When we consider something as loose and transient as a caucus, it is perhaps inappropriate to call it an organization.
* All societies in modern times have had large numbers of NGOs at least at the local level
* Presence or absence of a democratic political culture is one of the major variables determining the number of NGOs.
* Size of a country, its ethnic, religious and cultural diversity, the complexity of its economy and the quality of its communications infrastructure are also crucial importance
* We may distinguish different activities, most common distinction is between operational and campaigning NGOs
* Operational NGOs have to mobilize resources in order to sustain projects and programs, and need to possess an efficient headquarters bureaucracy
* Campaigning NGOs will carry out much the same functions, but with a different balance between them
* Only the defining activities - implementing projects or holding demonstrations - serve to differentiate them
* Distinctions are not as sharp as the labels suggest
* Various other types of NGOs can be regarded as promoting change by variants on these primary functions. Range across a spectrum from those promoting an academic, non-political image to those collating and disseminating information for campaign purposes
* NGOs should not be contrasted with social movements, because NGOs are _essential_ components of social movements
* In the 1990s, four mutually-reinforcing processes of change led to emphasis on the concept of civil society:
  * explosion in global communication facilities
  * new forms of private association were recognized
  * fall of communist regimes
  * major UN conferences produced an unprecedented scale of public engagement
* **The simplest, most common meaning given to "civil society" is all public activity.** In the broadest sense, it encompasses all social, economic, cultural and political relations
* The United Nations used the term civil society to express its desire to strengthen its relations with both companies and NGOs
* **NGOs are very likely to be political in the broadest sense of affecting social discourse and can often have an indirect effect on politics in the narrow sense of shaping public policy.**
* The point of this debate about terminology is to emphasize that NGOs are not just well-meaning, uncontroversial, non-political groups
* There is often confusion about the role of NGOs in democratic political processes
* a wider view of democracy totally legitimizes the role of NGOs
* policy-making could not be democratic without the active participation of NGOs
