For my final MGNPO paper, I'm tasked with writing a critical review of a book related to nonprofit management. The title that I chose is _Managing Leadership Transition for Nonprofits: Passing the Torch to Sustain Organizational Excellence_ by Dym, Egmont, and Watkins (2011). The following is my outline of the material.

### Chapter 1 - What Makes Nonprofit Leadership So Challenging?

* The question of fit is complicated by the variety of circumstances that set the scene for each transition—circumstances that affect the balance between welcome and resistance to new leaders.
* Here, then, is the picture of an astoundingly difficult job with surprisingly little guidance.
* Nonprofit CEOs are responsible to many, often entitled, constituencies.
* Attending to so many groups is hard enough, but reconciling their often conflicting interests makes the job much harder.
* nonprofits have two quite different customers: those they serve and those that pay the way
* Many talented leaders have learned to affirm this need to “lead from the middle” and have built a set of negotiating skills designed to weave many disparate people and ideas into a coherent vision. But even when they succeed, they succeed with much more effort and patience than they might have thought would be the rule.
* Transition teams and boards of directors must take on some of the burden of negotiation and consensus building among stakeholders. At the least, they must introduce new leaders with one voice and maintain a unity of purpose—publically and privately—with the leader during her initial efforts to get her feet on the ground.
* Few new leaders arrive on the scene with expertise in board development, finance, marketing, labor negotiations, and fund-raising. The learning curve is steep
* Working 12 to 15 hours a day, CEOs burn out.
* Experienced CEOs find ways to manage the demand. They become masters at dropping in on events and meetings for their specific part of the agenda without being trapped in discussions where they are not needed.
* carefully select actions that lead to small achievements, which over time can build on each other.
* seek places where they can serve as the catalyst for other leaders and followers to take up a challenge and carry it forward.
* coach team members, staff, and volunteers who can take on leadership tasks so the organization moves forward under a larger and stronger leadership team.
* The skills required to rise to the CEO position are often far more management focused than the leadership skills that are ultimately required once a nonprofit professional has attained this position.
* management skills that require a short-range focus on technical or programmatic actions.
* CEO position, she is expected to focus on the far horizon.
* CEOs who have led increasingly larger organizations observe that they receive higher pay but more importantly are blessed with senior leaders in every area of the work. It may take a budget of $5 million or more for the CEO to be at liberty to actually dedicate her time to vision and strategy, development of governance and policy, and organization-wide evaluation and innovation toward achieving the mission.
* CEOs are often isolated. Many of the issues they deal with cannot be appropriately shared with other staff or fully understood by board members.
* They have no one who “gets” the difficulty of their days, no one to give advice. Peer interaction, an exceptional board president, or an executive coach can make a huge difference
* group of closely held advisors should not be constituents involved in the organization. Rather, they should be selected for objectivity and a willingness to listen to ideas that are not necessarily completely formed and to speak frankly about their impressions and reactions without needing to see change.
* A community advisory panel may be utilized as a more formal system for helping the leader both test and expand her perspective.
* CEOs often come into their leadership role with significantly less experience on or with boards of directors than the board members with whom they partner.
* It is a difficult process for anyone to lead the group that hired you, evaluates your performance, and has the power to end your relationship with the organization.
* No matter how often the CEO reminds the board that “your only operations job is to hire, fire, and evaluate me,” boards inevitably express opinions and actively intervene in program matters.
* Some CEOs are new to their community. They don’t know the local culture, its values, and the networks of influence, power, and money. Yet they are required, almost immediately, to position the organization to make friends, raise money, recruit staff, nurture a volunteer corps, develop programs, and so forth.
* the CEO must develop a thick skin. For those who can’t, the job can be painful.
* CEO needs the support of senior staff and board members who “have his back.” These supporters need to speak out when detractors are premature or acting because of preference for an unsuccessful candidate for the job.
* Every CEO needs some leeway for growing into leadership of the organization and a learning process that includes forgiveness for early mistakes.
* needs to create a unified culture. Basically, any culture emanates from the way things are done in that organization.
* Whether the organization’s current culture is healthy or needs reshaping, the CEO cannot lead until he understands it.
* One of the most difficult organizational culture issues is how conflict is addressed.
* The skills and temperamental inclinations of an individual performer need to change to motivate others to work through and with them. Sometimes it is hard for new leaders to realize, “It’s not all about me.”
* If a leader is not cognizant of the organization’s culture or is not facile in reading her impact upon a group, initial misunderstandings may get in the way of winning over followers
* most people taking leadership of a nonprofit understand there will be limited resources, the extent to which this is true affects the CEO’s ability to lead. If all of the agency’s funding is short term and fractured into separated funds dedicated to individual programs, the leader may feel his hands are tied. It is difficult to have an impact in any meaningful way if every dollar’s use is designated
* The relationship between board president and CEO can change frequently. Both CEOs and presidents come and go. In some organizations, for instance, the bylaws mandate that the presidency turns over every two years.
* means that the CEO-president partnership undergoes constant change. At its best, the partnership is well negotiated, but, even so, there is a period of uncertainty
* the CEO must work with the president and governance committee to encourage continual learning on the part of the president and board if the organization desires to create a continual learning culture.
* On the other side of the experience equation, some board members have served on other boards and insist that each organization should be run the same way.
* Just as alignment with the organizational culture is essential to a successful CEO, experienced board members soon find that previous experience and ways of work are not necessarily portable
* Leadership in the nonprofit sector is not for the faint of heart.

### Chapter 2 - Why Transitions Fail

* Leadership transition is a defining moment in an organization’s life, a time to review what the organization is about—
* transition fails when it does not further long-term strategic aims, when it leads to a brief, unproductive tenure, when it does not unite the organization around future development, and when organizational problems that led up to the leader’s departure remain more or less intact.
* Leadership transitions, even successful ones, are rarely smooth.
* Pitfalls during the transition process generally can be classified as issues of the following:
  * Leadership and governance
  * Organizational characteristics
  * The external environment
  * Planning and execution
* Resisting the pent-up demand for action and requests from a line of staff at the door on a variety of issues requires patience. Not acting soon enough has equally negative consequences.
* Hopefully, the culture changes as an organization grows; but often the time lag is significant.
* redefining organizational signs and ways of work are necessary to successful transitions.
* Change can threaten vested interests and make people anxious. It poses a threat even when it means leaving behind painful or dysfunctional ways of operating.
* When people know that change is inevitable, they can support it and see a benefit from changing. As a result, a learning organization is created.
* Leadership transition is generally seen as the change from one CEO to another, but in fact it involves the introduction of an individual into a system with many processes and series of relationships.
* it keeps happening each time a board president completes his term.
* realization that there will be continual transitions should lead the board to put processes in place to make them go smoothly.
* Often the relationship between the CEO and the board president influences organizations more than either of them does individually. When the two are at cross purposes, ineffectuality, crisis, and turnover are likely.
* important to think of leadership transitions not in individual but in partnership terms.
* Even the best CEO or board president is only as good as the fit and partnership they have with one another.
* Many new organizations want and expect their CEO to be all things: inspired leader, orderly manager, brilliant strategist, great fund raiser, and community builder.
* Rarely can one person “save” an organization.
* It’s imperative to establish clear and reasonable expectations of our leaders and of ourselves. Leadership is not a person. It is a collective action in which the “leader” and the “led” meet challenges together.
* give people time and resources to succeed, observe how they do, and regularly adjust our expectations and support
* A careful strategic planning process is a good antidote for crisis orientation.
* Commitment to planning can give perspective and distance that allows the organization’s horizon to shift
* Time and care continue to be needed after the hire. Exhausted by the greatly increased burden of work created by the transition, the transition team may hand the leadership reigns over to the new leader before he is reasonably integrated
* When the work of the transition is slow to start or goes on for many months, anxiety can become a part of the organizational culture.
* Sometimes board members assume that the CEO will always know what to do.
* New CEOs often express surprise at learning information that wasn’t obvious (or was even hidden) during the hiring process.
* adherence to a disciplined process of developing a strategic vision of the future, assessing the organization’s strengths and weaknesses, as well as addressing the root cause of the most recent departure sets a sturdy framework for a successful transition process.

### Chapter 3 - Mission, Vision, and Effective Leadership

* The fundamental challenge for all leaders is to align their organizations in the service of their mission and vision,
* These “soft” disciplines steady, orient, and drive the leader. When taken seriously, they provide discipline, inspiration, and guideposts for everything organizations do.
* The mission defines what the organization is all about, its reason for being, and what it stands for.
* vision is an idealistic and realistic picture of the future, a declaration of where you and others want to be and believe you can be in five or more years.
* Everything a leader does becomes an expression and an extension of the organizational vision.
* Dedication to mission and vision ennobles leaders,
* “Starting with the mission and its requirements may be the first lesson business can learn from successful nonprofits,”
* a sincere mission statement, if it is kept vividly in mind and invoked with great frequency, provides coherence and discipline
* Missions communicate the basic philosophy upon which an organization is built. A great mission effectively communicates the direction that the organization is headed to
* begins to frame the culture and ethics of an organization.
* The mission should provide a touchtone for decision making at all levels
* **essential that the mission statement be revisited at the beginning of transition.**
* The organizational vision is just that: a picture and a story. It is more evocative than analytic.
* underlying purpose of visions is to imagine and name the fundamental change required of organizations to realize their missions.
* changes are twofold:
  * First, there are concrete changes
  * Second, everything we do will be infused with the values and spirit of the mission
* organizational processes will mirror, teach, and amplify the power of these values
* organizations motivated by missions and visions aim to transform the organizational culture, and by changing the culture they change the way people think and feel about themselves and the world around them.
* **paradigm shift is the ultimate aim of organizational missions and visions.**
* people want three things from their leader: _direction, trust, and hope_
* vision statement is comprehensive.
* breaks the more abstract vision into concrete, realizable objectives, and it demonstrates what kind of strategies will bring the objectives to realization.
* Too many mission and vision statements are so general or grandiose that people within the organization don’t relate to them and customers don’t notice.
  * One reason these statements are easy to ignore is that they are carelessly done.
  * Another is that they have no bite.
  * third reason that mission and vision statements fail is that they are often inward looking. Instead, **the point of focus must be outward, on what the organization produces for its customers.**
* John Kotter has outlined the practical characteristics of an effective vision.
  * Imaginable
  * Desirable
  * Feasible
  * Focused
  * Flexible
  * Communicable
* three more qualities of an effective vision:
  * Authentic
  * Broadly owned
  * Leads from strength
* three questions that need to be answered in formulating a mission:
  * What is our business/mission?
  * Who is our customer?
  * What does the customer value?
* **visions must be owned by those who rally behind them and carry them out.**
* John Kotter has provided a tidy listing of the “Key Elements in the Effective Communication of Vision:”
  * Simplicity
  * Metaphor, analogy, and example
  * Multiple forums
  * Leadership by example
  * Explanation of seeming inconsistencies
  * Give and take
* more often than others, great leaders live their mission and vision.
* Their action is or appears to be today what the organization aspires to be tomorrow.
* <b>Revisioning</b>
  * Whereas mission statements often hold for lengths of time, vision statements do not. They must be adapted to new circumstances.
  * some circumstances that commonly require or call forth the revision of the organizational vision.
    * _Leadership Transitions_
      * all leaders must reshape vision statements to fit their own goals, character, style of working, and values, but the change can range from small to radical,
    * _Lack of Alignment_
      * Signs that the organization is out of alignment include moving without purpose, being out of sync with community needs and technological trends,
    * _Changes in the Social, Political, or Economic Climate_
    * _Troubled Situations_
    * _Mergers, Acquisitions, and Strategic Alliances_
    * _Board Leadership Transitions_
    * _Aligning to Vision_
    * _Internal Clarity and Coherence of Leadership_
    * _Bridges_
      * Deep connections are built through bridges. When roles are well negotiated, for example, leaders are designated champions of visions.
    * _Strategic Thinking_
    * _Leveraging_
    * _Managing to Strategy_
    * _Opportunism_
* <b>Resilience: riding the cycles and stages of organization development</b>
  * It takes a long time for vision to permeate the organization, for all to be infused with it. It is like cultural change.
  * Culture anchors everything else: structure, processes and procedures, and planning.
  * Visions and missions eventually enter the culture. They form its backbone. They become the almost unconscious basis for setting priorities, making decisions, structuring work, and management practice.
  * leaders give up too quickly on the veracity and the power of missions and visions.
  * Once a vision is crafted, however, and seems to be backed by a good percentage of the people—leaders—it needs to be talked up and supported by creating structures and processes in keeping with its message.
    * takes persistence but not stubbornness
  * With time, missions and visions take on a life of their own.
  * momentum builds, the leader feels this energy around him and senses that his moves are in some ways more than his own. He is speaking for something greater and, by so doing, has become something greater than himself.

### Chapter 4 - Leadership and Strategy

*
*




* The transition team will have to help people through three critical steps:
  * _Holding people together_ as they let go of the old ways of doing things and deal with the losses they feel because of those changes.
  * _Helping people hang on_ through what William Bridges calls the “neutral zone”—the time when the new isn’t fully operational, but the old is gone.
  * _Assisting people in making a new beginning_, reinforcing their first steps in new systems and ways of work, showing appreciation for people’s willingness to learn to change, and helping them celebrate what and who the organization is becoming.
* <b>Holding people together</b>
  * In the first phase—letting go of the old ways—some will temporarily lose their sense of competence. They will feel uncomfortable and need to be assured
  * There inevitably will be a chain of cause and effect collisions. When A changes, B no longer works and a new C needs to be developed.
  * want to identify and discuss who is losing what and try to foresee what secondary changes will probably occur and what will be different when each change is completed.
  * stakeholders together need to accept the reality of what is changing, and everyone needs to appreciate the importance of the subjective losses each is accepting for the good of the whole organization.
  * expect overreaction from some people in the initial phases of the transition.
  * express concern and sympathy openly while gently turning people’s attention to the future.
  * may want to develop a transition management dashboard.
  * During this time of transition, the team will need the patience of Job as they give people information over and over until it is heard, understood, and acted upon. This is how new realities are built in organizations.
  * clear and continual communication of transition information will also prevent people from individually deciding what to abandon, by preference rather than by the need to realign.
  * During transition there is a need for rituals or ceremonies that dramatize the things that are ending,
  * The entire team needs to stay on message: This is about aligning everything we do to move the mission forward.
* <b>Helping people hang on</b>
  * Leading people through the second step, the neutral zone, is difficult.
  * things are changing, but they do not yet have all the details or perhaps even a clear sense of what new way will come.
  * strongly committed leadership is necessary
  * In creating things for people to hold onto during the transition, it will be necessary for the team to create temporary systems.
  * need to strengthen organization-wide connections so that they create champions of change at every level
  * need to encourage creativity at every level to find the right fit in all of the systems.
* <b>Assisting people in making a new beginning</b>
  * important for the team to encourage people to ask questions.
  * If people don’t understand why changes have occurred, they won’t be able to absorb them.
  * connect changes to storytelling.
  * important that the team help the organization face both the good and bad facts
  * the team needs to be consistent in how it reinforces the new beginning
  * ensure that systems have been reorganized for the “new beginning.”
  * find ways to ensure and celebrate some quick successes
  * help stakeholders recapture the dream that brought them into the organization
  * highlight the outcomes that change, no matter how difficult, will produce for the organization.
