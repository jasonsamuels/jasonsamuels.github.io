### Collaborating With Customer Communities: Lessons From the Lego Group, Antorini, Muñiz, Jr. and Askildsen. Sloan Management Review (2002)

* would it be like if you found that you had hundreds if not thousands of knowledgeable users of your products ready and eager to spend nights and weekends acting as extensions of your research and development department?
* In 2005, Lego created the Ambassador Program
* Through trial and error, Lego has developed a solid understanding of what it takes to build and maintain profitable and mutually beneficial collaborations with users
* user-created innovations have expanded the Lego play experience and pushed the use of Lego materials into new and virtual media
* Cumulatively, the fan activity represents a vast library of free ideas
* Historically, Lego was an extremely private company
* public position was "We don't accept unsolicited ideas."
* late 1990s, Lego Mindstorms contained software and hardware to create small customizable and programmable robots.
* users found ways to hack into the code and adapt the new products; they talked about their innovations on independent websites.
  * presented Lego management with a choice: either pursue legal action the hackers or invite users to collaborate on new products and applications
* new CEO, Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, in 2004 provided the opportunity for Lego to reflect on the meaning of the brand as well as the value of the company's ties with the user community
  * "We think innovation will come from a dialogue with the community," he told a North American user convention in 2005
* began in March 2004 by selecting an adult fan team leader, who set up a secure forum where users could share their designs
  * few short weeks later, the level of fan activity was tremendous
  * "I was overwhelmed by the quality."
  * success of this project "sent shock waves through our development organization."
* Based on its experience working with dedicated users, Lego management has developed an informed view on the circumstances under which collaborating closely with users works well- and on when it doesn't.
  * _When it works well_
    * most successful when outside parties have a particular area of expertise, such as architecture or sensor design and manufacture, that individuals within the company don't have
    * having innovations that can be pretested by potential customers helps eliminate bugs and reduce risk
    * Cocreating knowledge-intensive innovations with users allows Lego to obtain the skills and knowledge important to these activities
    * in recent years Lego has hired more than 20 adult fans
  * _When it causes difficulties_
    * less successful in cases where users seek to push the products beyond their intended limits
    * Whereas the primary end users from Lego's perspective are children, adult fans often think about developing products for other adults
* <b>Core principles for successful interaction with users</b>
  * _Be clear about rules and expectations_
    * Lego learned that it had to be more specific about its expectations upfront, including when its projects would begin and end
    * adult users were more cooperative When they negotiated expectations with the Lego employees directly involved
  * _Ensure a win-win_
    * the collaborations themselves needed to be rewarding experiences for the users
    * intrinsic rewards associated with designing and building products are frequently more motivating than financial rewards
    * Lego has tended to pay outside collaborators with a combination of experience, access and Lego products
    * users who participate in long-term projects or who provide services that are more like "work" are given a choice: they can receive free products or a more conventional stipend
  * _Recognize that outsiders aren't insiders_
    * relationship with other fans and the input and encouragement they offer that strongly motivate these users to keep raising the creative bar
    * User communities are not just extensions of the company - they are independent entities
  * _Don't expect one size to fit all_
    * different users prefer different modes of communication, and different types of innovations call for different environments
    * Lego relies on many different collaboration platforms. The simplest are polls and electronic idea boxes
    * A more advanced platform, Lego Digital Designer allows users to design virtual Lego models and create digital building instructions
    * allows innovators with different skill levels to participate
    * Newer platform, Lego Cuusoo, allows users to upload designs (drawings, photos, etc.) to a Web page where other Lego users and consumers in general can vote on the design.
      * If a design receives 10,000 votes, Lego agrees to consider it for possible production; if the design is commercialized, innovators receive 1% of the total net sales
    * Finally, the company shapes new ideas through user panels and virtual project rooms
      * restricted forums gather input from very skilled users on complex, long-term projects
  * _Be as open as possible_
    * Today Lego uses NDAs more sparingly, to limit information sharing with third parties only in narrowly defined situations-thus ensuring that collaborators are able to interact with each other to the maximum extent Lego also attempts to maintain transparency in all matters related to collaboration
    * And the company supports community initiatives aimed at improving idea sharing among community members and advancing innovation
    * These lessons are applicable to other organizations. Instead of regarding collaboration as something that needs to be managed exclusively by the company, it is fruitful to think of it as an ongoing dialogue between two allies
    * Frequently, the two sets of resources complement each other and advance the conversation and collaboration
  
### When Senior Managers Won’t Collaborate, Gardner. Harvard Business Review (2015)

* As clients have globalized and confronted more-sophisticated technological, regulatory, economic, and environmental demands, they’ve sought help on increasingly complex problems
* The only way to address clients’ most complex issues, then, is for specialists to work together across the boundaries of their expertise.
* many partners are hard-pressed to spend time and energy on cross-specialty ventures when they could be building their own practices instead
* **True multidisciplinary collaboration requires people to combine their perspectives and expertise and tailor them to the client’s needs so that the outcome is more than the sum of the participating individuals’ knowledge**
* research examines these tradeoffs through quantitative analyses of a decade’s worth of detailed financial and time-sheet records
* findings show how the benefits of collaboration play out.
* paint a realistic picture of the barriers that often prevent professionals from working together.
* suggest changes that both individuals and firms can make
* <b>The benefits to the firm</b>
  * For a firm, the financial benefits of multidisciplinary collaboration are unambiguous.
  * in part because cross-specialty work is likely to be less subject to price-based competition
  * clients view single-specialty expertise (about a basic tax issue, for instance) as a commodity that can be awarded to the lowest bidder
  * moving beyond siloed services to complex, interdependent engagements allows a professional services firm to work for more-senior executives in a client’s organization
  * multidisciplinary projects builds loyalty by creating switching barriers
  * partners’ ability to see their colleagues’ work lowers the risk of illicit rogue behavior (something that is admittedly rare but can be fatal)
* <b>How individuals benefit</b>
  * benefits of collaboration to individuals are equally quantifiable, if less intuitive
  * professionals who contribute to colleagues’ client work sell more services to their own clients
  * referrals are a more-efficient way to generate work than prospecting
  * On average, partners got a new client referral within a year from one in every six colleagues they teamed up with
  * likely to spread word of your expertise to colleagues who need it
  * compounded effect of word of mouth is powerful
  * Collaboration raises a partner’s profile with colleagues but also in the wider market
  * recommendations lead not only to more work but also to more-sophisticated and more-lucrative work
  * Complex projects give individuals access to high-level executives in the client organization
  * Cross-disciplinary collaboration also helps insulate professionals from economic downturns
  * Some of this benefit derives from the social cohesion
  * learned to handle a broader set of topics
* <b>What gets in the way</b>
  * it’s no secret that the organizational structure, compensation systems, and cultures in many, if not most, professional services firms favor individual contributors rather than team players
  * competitive values become so ingrained that the winners find it counterintuitive to collaborate when they become partners.
  * many firms value “rock stars, not the whole band.”
  * The effects of the compensation system bleed into the culture, which disparages “service partners,”
  * some of the advantages firms gain from collaboration may come at the expense of individuals
  * increased transparency, for instance, can feel from the professionals’ point of view like heightened scrutiny
  * External reward systems also play a role in encouraging professionals to develop a reputation for specialized expertise. For example in public "star ranking" systems
  * As if these financial concerns weren’t enough, learning to collaborate effectively is difficult
  * coordinating with peers across departments is significantly harder than delegating to junior staffers
* <b>Getting to the Benefits Sooner</b>
  * people have figured out that perseverance pays off
  * Certain strategies can help professionals reap the benefits of collaboration sooner.
    * matters whom you collaborate with
  * You might get high-status partners to work with you on the basis of your knowledge and expertise, but getting them to keep working with you hinges on their experience of you as a team player. Rules:
    * Don’t squeeze your team members
    * Deliver what you committed to on time, without reminders
    * Communicate openly
* <b>Organizing for higher-value work</b>
  * _The leader as coach_
    * begin with themselves, modeling the right behavior by contributing to others’ client work and sharing credit with those who participate
    * also take some simple steps to help partners build trusting relationships - for instance holding retreats
    * The best firms also pair lateral hires with a successful homegrown partner
    * resist the temptation to bring in high-performing but selfish partners, who might be a toxic influence
    * seek candidates who have a track record of working across boundaries
    * To gauge that, ask applicants to give several concrete examples of how they contributed to others’ client work and how they built teams
    * Candidates who brag about their ability to transfer clients to your firm should send up a red flag
    * Leaders also need to be careful about commending players for great outcomes. When a partner makes a big sale as a lone wolf, talk with them about better ways to achieve the same outcome
  * _The leader as architect_
    * metrics can be gamed, trying to reward them can be counterproductive
    * far better to reward the outcomes of effective collaboration, such as rising levels of client satisfaction and client retention, growth in revenue and profits, acquisition of new clients
    * include measures that capture partners’ contributions to nonbillable efforts such as mentoring, sharing knowledge, and giving advice
* Under such a deliberately cross-specialty collaboration strategy, time spent learning to work together is treated not as nonbillable overhead but as an investment in remaining competitive

### Integrating the Enterprise, Ghoshal and Gratton. Sloan Management Review (2002)

* Vertical "command and control" sabotages organizations that need bottom-up innovation to be competitive. Yet organizational integration is increasingly essential
* technology is helping cutting-edge companies meet the challenge by integrating horizontally.
* One of the most fundamental and enduring tensions in all but very small companies is between subunit autonomy and empowerment on the one hand and overall organizational integration and cohesion on the other
* it is possible to balance those tensions successfully by implementing four kinds of horizontal integration for achieving cohesion without hierarchy
* empowered units improved both the speed and the quality of responsiveness to market demands — and fostered increased innovation
* also led to fragmentation and to deficiencies in internal integration.
* **few incentives to share knowledge or other resources, particularly when evaluation of their performance focused primarily on how their own unit was doing, rather than on how the unit contributed to the company's overall performance.**
* The need for integration to counterbalance internal differentiation is an old chestnut.
* Information sharing has always been at the heart of integration, but now technology allows organizations to respond to integration needs in ways that were unavailable even five years ago
* networks are still a powerful tool for socializing people and building organizational cohesion, they are less common — in part because lifetime careers and on- demand mobility of employees can no longer be assumed.
* drastic pruning of middle management that many companies undertook in the 1990s deprived them of an important but often unrecognized source of organizational integration.
* perhaps the most important change is in management philosophy
* In the past, integration was managed primarily through vertical processes
* Although there has always been a recognition of the relevance of horizontal integration mechanisms, in practice they have been seen as secondary, as reinforcement to the primary vertical processes.
* **the most fundamental change we have observed is the primary reliance on horizontal processes that build integration on top of subunit autonomy and empowerment**
* <b>Four Critical Components of Horizontal Integration</b>
  * The four areas are simultaneously distinct and interrelated. The challenge is to manage the interrelationships synergistically
  * _Operational Integration Through Standardized Technological Infrastructure_
    * The bottleneck in rationalizing and integrating those activities lies in IT system
    * By standardizing those, we have channelled that entrepreneurship where it adds value — in serving customers.
    * Standardizing operating processes has always been a powerful integrating device, but it wasn't possible to create centrally managed, standard IT systems until now.
    * **biggest benefits flow at the extreme, not with half-measures**
  * _Intellectual Integration Through Shared Knowledge Base_
    * user _pull_ must supplement the technological _push_, effective integration of knowledge requires a clear strategic link and extensive communication
    * What made the case study system work was not only the world-class IT infrastructure nor the tremendous effort and investment that kept its information current, but also the **link between the system and the company's strategy**
    * Also contributing to the system's success were company efforts to build interpersonal relationships, or "soft bonds," to promote knowledge sharing
    * conversation forums — Friday morning breakfast meetings, top-level "Board Away" days and other functions
    * motto that "the most important role of managers is to create friendships,"
  * _Social Integration Through Collective Bonds of Performance_
    * enormous advantages can result when peer-to-peer interactions are extended to traditionally vertical areas
    * "People do not learn, at least in a corporate environment, without a target
    * if you say, 'Look, the learning is necessary in order to cut the cost of drilling a well by 10%,' then they will learn with purpose."
    * BP's peer groups is their effectiveness in transferring, sharing and leveraging cumulative learning through a direct link with performance
  * _Emotional Integration Through Shared Identity and Meaning_
    * A shared knowledge base must translate into coordinated and aligned action across the different parts of an organization, or it is only an expensive library
    * for most companies, hierarchy is no longer as effective — not only because it destroys front-line initiative and entrepreneurship, but also because of its inability to cope with uncertainty and rapid change
    * Fluid and flexible collective action requires not only standardized infrastructure, shared knowledge and mutual trust, but also emotional integration through a common purpose and identity
    * **"Quite simply, none of us is as smart as all of us."**
    * client focus provides a force for emotional integration with outsiders, pride in the quality of colleagues is an equally powerful force
    * Inherently linked to the identity shaping pride of belonging is a broader sense of purpose that emotionally connects each individual to the ethos of the firm.
* <b>A framework for horizontal integration</b>
  * For effective horizontal integration, managers have to connect the company's knowledge bases, build social relationships among people and shape a shared sense of identity, all supported by a standardized technological infrastructure
* <b>Entrepreneurial Activity and Horizontal Integration Co-Evolve
  * individual and subunit autonomy co-evolve with horizontal integration in a dynamic process.
  * Instead of smothering bottom-up initiatives, horizontal integration creates a reinforcing process through which both autonomy and integration can flourish.
  * **A cautionary note: The symbiotic co-evolution of autonomy and horizontal integration takes time to mature**
  * to develop people's self-confidence and to build trust and friendship can be achieved only through persistent action and reinforcement over time
  * have to he relentless in driving the process, they also have to he patient about results
  * For those who respond well to that challenge, the ultimate benefits are durable enhancement of organizational capability and sustainable improvement of business performance.

### Managing Your Mission-Critical Knowledge, Ihrig and Macmillan. Harvard Business Review (2015)

* When executives talk about “knowledge management” today, the conversation usually turns very quickly to the challenge of big data and analytics.
* proving difficult to translate into useful knowledge.
* big data is something even more important—the proper management of all their strategic knowledge assets:
  * core competencies
  * areas of expertise
  * intellectual property
  * deep pools of talent
* In the absence of a clear understanding of the knowledge drivers of an organization's success, the real value in dig data will never materialize
* <b>Map your knowledge assets</b>
  * first step is to put boundaries around what you’re trying to do
  * parse out your mission-critical knowledge
  * Identifying and mapping strategic knowledge is iterative
  * generally start by assembling a multifunctional team
  * shape this conversation by giving individuals assignments in advance.
  * Your list of key assets should ultimately include some that are “hard,” such as technical proficiency, and some that are “soft,” such as a culture that supports intelligent risk taking.
  * You may also have identified knowledge that you should possess but don’t
  * next step is to map your assets on a simple grid along two dimensions: tacit versus explicit (_unstructured versus structured_) and proprietary versus widespread (_undiffused versus diffused_).
    * _Unstructured versus structured_
      * Unstructured (tacit) knowledge involves deep, almost intuitive understanding that is hard to articulate
        * generally rooted in great expertise
      * Structured (explicit or codified) knowledge is easier to communicate
        * common language, rules of thumb, and conceptual framework
    * _Undiffused versus diffused_
      * most companies have certain broadly shared competencies
      * Some knowledge, of course, is diffused far beyond the boundaries of the organization
* <b>Interpret the map</b>
  * Simply mapping your knowledge assets and then discussing the map with your senior team can uncover important insights and ideas for value creation
* <b>Identify new opportunities</b>
  * Mapping knowledge assets and discussing their implications often leads directly to strategic insights
  * also helpful to systematically explore what would happen if knowledge were moved around or different spheres of it were combined. Examples:
    * _Selectively structure tacit knowledge_ (move it up on your map’s Y axis)
    * _Disseminate knowledge within the company_ (move it to the right on your map’s X axis)
    * _Diffuse knowledge outside the company_ (move it farther right on your map’s X axis)
      * Elon Musk quote: “You want to be innovating so fast that you invalidate your prior patents, in terms of what really matters. It’s the velocity of innovation that matters.”
    * _Contextualize knowledge_ (move it down on your map’s Y axis
      * Contextualization can also come from combining structured and unstructured knowledge
      * **codified information as a networking tool**:
        * notice who wrote an article
        * then talk with that person directly
        * many companies build competitive advantage on just such combinations
    * _Discover new knowledge (move it to the left on your map’s X axis)_
      * most challenging—and highest-potential—opportunities often come from spotting connections between disparate areas of expertise
* In the pursuit of innovation, flashes of insight can come from many sources
* It’s not easy to systematize this part of the knowledge- development process, which arises to some extent from intuition, tacit knowledge, and time spent studying the map
* competitors will have access to the same kinds of data and general industry knowledge that you do. So your future success depends on developing a new kind of expertise: **the ability to leverage your proprietary knowledge strategically and to make useful connections between seemingly unrelated knowledge assets or tap fallow, undeveloped knowledge**
* Once you’ve mapped your mission- critical knowledge assets, the challenge is to be disciplined about which of them to develop and exploit, keeping future growth front and center.
* Remember, strategy always includes deciding what _not_ to do
