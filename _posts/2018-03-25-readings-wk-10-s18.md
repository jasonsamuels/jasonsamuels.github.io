### McAffee, A. Mastering the Three Worlds of Information Technology. Harvard Business Review, November 2006

* American companies spend as much on IT each year as they do on offices, warehouses, and factories put together
* One of the biggest problems companies face is coping with the abundance of technologies in the marketplace
* Adding to executives’ diffidence, corporate IT projects have often delivered underwhelming results or been outright failures
* survey of 782 American executives responsible for IT, 50% of the respondents admitted that “aligning business and IT strategy” was a major problem
* managers who distance themselves from IT abdicate a critical responsibility
* executives have three roles to play:
  * help select technologies
  * nurture their adoption
  * ensure their exploitation
* Different types of IT result in different kinds of organizational change
* **What’s critical, though, is that executives stop looking at IT projects as technology installations and start looking at them as periods of organizational change that they have a responsibility to manage**
* One way to build a comprehensive model is to place IT in a historical context. IT is the latest in a series of general-purpose technologies (GPTs), innovations so important that they cause jumps in an economy’s normal march of progress
* Research suggests that four organizational complements—better-skilled workers, higher levels of teamwork, redesigned processes, and new decision rights—allow process GPTs to deliver improved performance
* Information technologies, my research shows, don’t enjoy the same relationships with the four organizational complements that other process GPTs have.
* IT sets off several kinds of revolutions in organizations because technologies fall into three distinct categories
* <b>Function IT</b>
  * technologies that make the execution of stand-alone tasks more efficient
  * Word processors and spreadsheets are the most common examples
  * People can get the most value from these technologies when their complements are in place but can also use FIT without all of the complements.
  * capabilities of this IT category:
    * Enhancing experimentation capacity
    * Increasing precision
* <b>Network IT</b>
  * provides a means by which people can communicate with one another
  * technologies include e-mail, instant messaging, blogs, and groupware
  * allows people to interact, but it doesn’t define how they should interact.
  * gives people freedom to experiment instead of telling them what they must do
  * brings complements with it but allows users to implement and modify them
  * principal capabilities include:
    * Facilitating collaboration
    * Allowing expressions of judgment
    * Fostering emergence
* <b>Enterprise IT</b>
  * the type of IT application that companies adopt to restructure interactions among groups of employees or with business partners, such as CRM or SCM
  * Unlike network technologies, which percolate from the bottom, enterprise technologies are very much top-down
  * Companies can’t adopt EIT without introducing new interdependencies, processes, and decision rights.
  * changes become necessary as soon as the new systems go live.
  * EIT’s primary capabilities include:
    * Redesigning business processes
    * Standardizing work flows
    * Monitoring activities and events efficiently
* Across the three IT categories, executives have three tasks:
  * <b>IT selection</b>
    * sensible question for executives to ask is “What do we need IT to do for us?”
    * **An inside-out approach puts the spotlight squarely on the business before evaluating the technology landscape**
    * Once the company’s business needs are clear, the technologies it requires will come into focus
    * Typically, FIT delivers productivity and optimization, NIT increases collaboration, and EIT helps standardize and monitor work
  * <b>IT adoption</b>
    * At this stage, managers’ main responsibility is to help create the complements that will maximize IT’s value.
    * Once network technologies are properly established, their use takes off, and the challenge for managers is to refrain from intervening too often or with too heavy a hand.
    * **In stark contrast to FIT and NIT, enterprise IT is hard for companies to adopt.**
    * benefits look great to people at the top, but employees usually dislike EIT technologies.
    * they don’t just enable new ways of working; they dictate them
    * Executives must intervene forcefully throughout EIT adoption efforts because new processes, changed decision rights, and greater interdependence come hand in hand
    * **the biggest mistake business leaders make is to underestimate resistance**
    * successful EIT adoptions decide at the outset how key issues about configuration and other aspects of the adoption will be raised and how they will be settled
    * most important participants are business leaders from the areas affected by the new technology
  * <b>IT exploitation</b>
    * Companies can best exploit FIT by fine-tuning organizational complements
    * Employees exploit older NITs such as e-mail and instant messaging on their own, but business leaders have a role to play in exploiting newer technologies
    * EIT’s exploitation is often easier than its adoption, since the work of imposing new processes is done by this stage
    * Exploiting EIT sometimes requires adding a new FIT on top of it.
* <b>The IT Dialogue</b>
  * Business and IT leaders should meet periodically to discuss the state of the company’s IT-based capabilities
  * discussions should cover organizational footprints: the geographic, functional, and divisional range over which the company will deploy new technologies
  * The expense, difficulty, and time involved in deploying IT—especially enterprise IT—increases as the footprint grows
  * _Functional IT_
    * Will any of the new software on the market enable our staff to do their jobs more efficiently?
    * Are our function technologies outdated?
  * _Network IT_
    * How do our people collaborate?
    * Do we have ways of letting qualitative information flow horizontally and vertically?
    * If we wanted to get broad feedback on an important topic, how would we do it?
    * How do we know what our people are working on?
  * _Enterprise IT_
    * In what ways are our current processes not supporting the needs of the business?
    * Are there best practices that should be embedded in our enterprise IT endeavors?
    * Are there important business activities, events, or trends that we should monitor?
    * What’s the most recent period that we could easily analyze?
  * **In reality, IT is never a sure bet because of the complex interplay between technologies, capabilities, and complements**
* **For a resource to have an impact on a company’s competitive position, it must be valuable, rare, inimitable, and nonsubstitutable.**
* people often forget that while the software itself might not be any of those things, a successfully implemented system isn’t easy to replicate.
* IT meets all four criteria when a company succeeds in applying a technology and, consequently, gains valuable capabilities.

### Downes, Larry and Nunes, Paul, Big Bang Disruption. Harvard Business Review, March, 2013

* The strategic model of disruptive innovation we’ve all become comfortable with has a blind spot.
* assumes that disrupters start with a lower-priced, inferior alternative that chips away at the least profitable segments, giving an incumbent business time to respond
* That advice hasn’t been much help to navigation-product makers who were decimated by Smartphones running Google Maps
* That kind of innovation changes the rules.
* now entire product lines—whole markets—are being created or destroyed overnight.
* We call these game changers “big-bang disrupters.” They don’t create dilemmas for innovators; they trigger disasters.
* big-bang disruptions are unplanned and unintentional.
* do not follow conventional strategic paths or normal patterns of market adoption.
* while there’s not a lot of evidence yet on how incumbents can survive them, we offer some strategic principles
* perhaps the biggest challenge to incumbents is that big-bang innovations come out of left field, combining existing technologies that don't even seem related to your offerings to achieve a dramatically better value proposition
* <b>Three devastating features</b>
  * _Unencumbered development_
    * innovators are not even trying to disrupt your business. You’re just collateral damage.
    * They are often born of rapid-fire, low-cost experiments on fast-maturing, ubiquitous technology platforms
    * They don’t need budget approval and aren’t vetted before development begins.
    * When cost is low and expectations are modest, entrepreneurs can just launch their idea and see what happens
    * In the future the most successful innovators may be those who simply happen upon the right combination of other people’s technologies.
    * **In the bizarro world of big-bang disrupters, it is perfectly rational to churn out dozens of new products and see which ones take hold.**
  * _Unconstrained growth_
    * Big-bang disruptions collapse the product life cycle we know
    * Now there are only two segments: trial users, who often participate in product development, and everyone else
    * This change obviates the need for the carefully timed shifts in marketing strategy
    * big-bang disruptions can be marketed to every segment simultaneously
    * The new product cycle can be simplified into three basic stages: development, deployment, and replacement
    * in today’s hyperinformed world, each epic failure feeds consumer expectations for the potential of something dramatically better.
    * Waiting for the market to take off and hoping to be a fast follower is now a recipe for irrelevance.
  * _Undisciplined strategy_
    * Big-bang disrupters contradict everything you know about competitive strategy
    * According to Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema’s classic The Discipline of Market Leaders (1995), businesses should align strategic goals along one—and only one—of three value disciplines:
      * low cost (“operational excellence”)
      * constant innovation (“product leadership”)
      * customized offerings (“customer intimacy”)
* Customers are so accustomed to this effect that they are coming to expect every product or service to get cheaper and better with each passing day.
* Under these conditions you can’t win simply by becoming more disciplined with your current strategy.
* Big-bang disrupters are rewriting the rules of industry after industry—and the new rules hold only until the next wave of disruption comes along. There's almost no time to adapt. Bold strategies are the only way to cope.
* Big-bang disruptions usually feature not a _vertically_ integrated supply chain but a _virtually_ integrated one: They are manufactured and deployed via the infrastructure of the cloud.
* Here are four strategies that incumbents have used to survive and even thrive in the face of big-bang disruption:
  * <b>See it coming</b>
    * You need new tools to recognize sooner than your competitors do that radical change is on the way
    * In every industry there are a handful of these visionaries, whose talents are based on equal parts genius and complete immersion in the industry’s inner workings. We call such seers “truth tellers,”
    * finding a truth teller is hard, learning when to listen is even harder.
    * Truth tellers are often eccentric, and their lucidity can easily be mistaken for arrogance and stubbornness
  * <b>Slow the disruptive innovation long enough to better it</b>
    * ensure that disrupters can’t make money from their inventions until you’re ready to acquire them or you can win with a product of your own
    * delay their profitability by lowering prices, locking in customers with long-term contracts, or forming strategic alliances with advertisers and other companies
  * <b>Get closer to the exits, and be ready for a fast escape</b>
    * even long-successful strategies may be suddenly upended, requiring a radical re-creation of the business
    * you have to prepare for immediate evacuation of current markets and be ready to get rid of once-valuable assets.
    * Traditional accounting still has little to say about the value of expertise, brands, patents, and other intangibles
    * For all other kinds of assets, a big-bang disruption can set off a rapid decline in value, making it important not only to shed those technologies but to do so before they become worthless
    * Facing the imminent arrival of a big-bang disrupter, companies must ruthlessly reassess their M&A strategies
    * Once customers shift to the new technology, it’s too late for a graceful exit—at best, it’s time for a fire sale.
  * <b>Try a new kind of diversification</b>
    * As industry change becomes less cyclical and more volatile, having a diverse set of businesses is vital.

### Navigating a World of Digital Disruption: BCG Perspectives: Drivers of New Industrial Architectures. 2015

* digital disruption is not a new phenomenon. But the opportunities and risks it presents shift over time. Competitive advantage flows to the businesses that see and act on those shifts first
* We are entering the third, and most consequential, wave of digital disruption
* In the first wave of the commercial internet, the dot-com era, falling transaction costs altered the traditional trade-off between richness and reach
* In the second wave, Web 2.0, the important strategic insight was that economies of mass evaporated for many activities. Small became beautiful. It was the era of the “long tail” and of collaborative production on a massive scale.
* Now we are on the **cusp of the third wave: hyperscaling.** Big—really big—is becoming beautiful. At the extreme—where competitive mass is beyond the reach of the individual business unit or company—hyperscaling demands a bold, new architecture for businesses.
* Unlike many of his rivals, Bezos saw **business architecture as a strategic variable**, not a given. He did not harness technology to the imperatives of his business model; he **adapted his business model to the possibilities—and the imperatives—of technology.**
* Since larger data sets yield better insights, big is beautiful. Data wants to be big, and businesses struggle to keep up
* The minimum efficient scale for data systems and facilities is rising beyond the reach of individual business units within a company, and ultimately beyond that of many companies
* Polarizing economics of mass are pushing the advantage simultaneously to the very big and the very small, and a new architecture is emerging for businesses of all sizes
* Building a shared data infrastructure will be one of the strategic challenges of the next decade for the health care industry and for policy makers.
* The health care industry is not an anomaly. Economies of “mass”—of scale, scope, and experience—are intensifying across the economy, driving new models of collaboration
* technologies can be extended infinitely and are all converging on the instantaneous
* Modularity and layering, granularity and extensibility, the symbiosis of the very large with very small: these are the recurrent themes of the transformative technologies of our era
* businesses in most industries have a classic oligopolistic structure, with a small number of companies competing on similar vertical value chains. In many cases, this will evolve into a much more diverse architecture of horizontal layers: infrastructure on the bottom, communities on the top, and traditional oligopolists in the middle.
* Stacks are a compelling model when the benefits of innovation at the top and higher utilization at the bottom exceed the additional transaction costs incurred by breaking up value chains.
* In the right circumstances, a stacked ecosystem blows up the classic trade-off between efficiency and innovation.
* what cannot be emphasized too much are the _differences_ among these four types of activity. They require different skills and motives, present different financial profiles to investors, and
need to be managed on different time horizons
* disruption takes very specific forms, and these forms are shifting
* leaders must adapt their strategies to the possibility of infrastructure that extends beyond the bounds of the business, to data that wants to be big
* Conventional business models may be simultaneously too big and too small.
* How should executives respond? Here are the four major drivers of the new industrial architecture and the key strategic imperatives for companies:
  * <b>Big data</b>
    * Test your current analytics against the state of the art. The field is moving so quickly that even the most well-versed companies can fall behind
    * Organizations capable of all this will be ones in which business managers, programmers, and mathematicians talk each other’s languages, where small teams iterate in fast cycles, where empirical validation counts for more than judgments of hierarchies or senior executives
    * Consolidate databases across the company.
    * Form partnerships to gain scale.
    * Manage data as a trustee
  * <b>Deconstruction</b>
    * Reorganize your business along its economic fault lines
    * Look for opportunities to be the lateral aggressor
    * Identify where your value chain is most susceptible to lateral attack
  * <b>Polarization of Economies of Mass</b>
    * “Up-source” activities to a community.
    * "Down-source" activities to shared infrastructure
  * <b>Holistic, Stacked Architectures</b>
    * Curate a new industrial stack.
    * Where you can’t curate your own stack, seek advantaged roles in stacks curated by others
    * Reshape regulation. Companies have a huge stake in how this thinking evolves, can and should influence policy in directions that favor efficiency at the bottom of the stack and open innovation at the top
