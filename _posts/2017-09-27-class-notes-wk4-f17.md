The theme this week was leadership. The week's readings centered on organizational culture, and cleared showed how culture impacts performance. Engaged and empowered employees = thriving organizations.

## Notes from Strategic Planning

In our Strategic Planning class this week we discussed the readings in our discussion forums, and conducted a purpose mapping activity to produce a causal map for the case study.

Professor Bryson suggested that we consider doing purpose mapping with our project team to help think about what our purposes are. I have a hunch that card sorting software could work to conduct the process online, and [OptimalSort](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort) has a free tier which could work if our group wants to try it.

* “Establishing an Urban Growth Area” case study
  * Basic logic of strategic planning is that you have a context of some kind which poses issues. Strategic planning and strategies are responses to situations.
  * Context of this case is that 27 of 29 cities were on board. Conflict isn’t widespread, planners are actually in a pretty strong position
  * Another important issue in this case, raised by the context, is protecting the integrity of the professional planners.
* OBSSR vision
  * Getting a room full of agreement is a collection of stakeholders, not a coalition of stakeholders
* Mission, mandates, and vision are all about purpose, about letting a group let purpose be their guide
* All kinds of approaches to thinking about change can be incorporated into a strategy change effort
* Help groups come to understand what their purposes are, use that to help the groups come up with strategies to meet their issues
* Purpose mapping activity
  * going to construct a causal map
  * Guidelines for individual brainstorming:
    * Start with a verb - try to make these actions
    * Use not more than 6 to 8 words
    * Don’t use _and_ or _or_
    * Don’t use words like _in order to_ or _because_
  * Silently, each person writes on post it notes 7-8 purposes that the Department of Juvenile Justice should serve
  * Proceed to grouping them together by theme and drawing arrows between them to show how they impact each other

## Notes from Strategic Human Resources Management

* Tonight we’re going to dive into leadership. We’ve been studying around the periphery of it but tonight we’re going to take it on directly.
* Tonight’s question: How does a public/nonprofit executive lead people using organizational and leadership theory?
* Posed to class: What do you think makes a leader?
  * Can get people to buy in
  * The ability to inspire change
  * Selfless
  * Brings out the best in others
  * Good at listening to what others are saying
  * Good at receiving feedback
  * Responsible
  * Can lead by example
* Is the leader responsible for the motivation of their group?
  * One answer was yes, but that idea was challenged. McGregor would not agree. Motivation is intrinsic. A leader creates an environment in which people’s intrinsic motivation emerges.
* Can leadership be taught?
  * Trick question. From [last week](/class-notes-wk4-f17), to become a leader you need to become your true self. Knowing who you are is the first and most important step.
  * Doesn’t necessarily need to be taught in a classroom. Can be modeled, mentored, self-taught.
  * Word that Professor Jay would use is “enhance.” Everyone has some intrinsic leadership skills
* Absolutely critical not only that you’re self aware, but that you’re open to feedback
* Autocrat who wants to tell you what to do and don’t talk back breeds resentment
* “Leadership is needed for problems that do not have easy answers”
* We oftentimes try to turn people into saviors when we shouldn’t. It’s not possible to be people’s greatest hopes.
* McGregor Theory X
  * Management is responsible
  * Process of Directing People
  * Without Direction, People Would Be Passive
  * People are lazy
  * People Lack Ambition and Prefer to be Led
  * People Are Self-Centered
  * People are Resistant to Change
  * People Are Gullible and Not Very Bright
* McGregor Theory Y
  * Management Is Responsible
  * People Are Not By Nature Passive or Resistant to Organizational Needs
  * People All Have:
    * Motivation
    * Potential for Development
    * Capacity for Assuming Responsibility
    * Readiness to Direct Behavior Toward Organizational Goals
  * Task of Management Is to Enable People to Achieve Their Own Goals Best By Directing Their Own Efforts
* James Macgregor Burns coined the phrase “transformational leadership” in the late-70s/early-80s. If you really want change leadership, both the leader and the follower need to be elevated to a higher moral plane. Everyone needs to feel that they can influence the group.
* Distinctive features of transformational leadership:
  * Idealized influence
  * Inspiring vision
  * Intellectual stimulation
  * Individualized consideration
* Leadership requires:
  * Self-development
  * Eye of the beholder (careful about perceiving your view of the world as the correct view)
  * Challenge = opportunity
  * Credibility
  * Shared vision
  * Trust needed
  * Shared values
  * Role models
  * One hop at a time
  * An affair of the heart (passion, you have to care)
* Humility is a key trait of successful leaders
* Make leadership more process-centered than executive-centered
