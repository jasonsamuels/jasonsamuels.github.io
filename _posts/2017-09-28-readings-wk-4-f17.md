## Strategic Planning

### Keeping and eye on the mirror: Image and identity in organizational adaptation, Dutton and Dukerich (1991)

* an organization's image and identity guide and activate individuals' interpretations of an issue and motivations for action on it, and those interpretations and motivations affect patterns of organizational action over time
* Models of how environments and organizations relate over time have typically assigned causal primacy to either environmental or organizational forces
* A focus on issues as a _starting point_ for interpretation and action in organizations charts a different course for seeing patterns of organizational action
* Some issues are routine and expected, members can easily classify them and they elicit a well-learned response. Other issues are not as easily interpreted or processed, may be problematic because they are nontraditional or because of feelings they evoke
* Analysis revealed that an organization's identity and image are critical constructs for understanding the relationship between actions on and interpretations of an issue over time.
* The article explores this concept through the case study of how the Port Authority of New York adapted in its response to a growing problem of homeless people in their facilities in the 1980s
  * The most significant change in the way the issue was defined during this period involved upper-level management's acceptance of some organizational responsibility for dealing with the issue
  * This interpretive shift expanded concern for humane solutions and a heightened awareness of the issue's severity
  * the organization's identity and image played a role in creating the pattern of how individuals in the organization interpreted and responded to the homelessness issue
  * the organization's image — how organization members thought others saw it — served as a gauge against which they evaluated and justified action on the issue
  * Over time, actions taken on issues reposition an organization in its environment by modifying tasks, allocation of resources, and assignments of personnel. The pattern of action on issues can therefore reinforce or potentially, transform the organization's identity and image through individuals' sense-making efforts, and the process of adaptation continues.
  * The Port Authority's identity shaped its members' interpretations of homelessness in at least three different ways.
    * Identity served as an important reference point for assessing the importance of the issue. Perceptions of issue importance are in turn important predictors of willingness to invest in an issue.
    * The expanding scope of the issue over time can be seen as an indication that the issue was being seen as more important and urgent as it threatened central identity components
    * Organization's identity defined what aspects of the issue were seen as a threat and helped to locate solutions that could transform the issue into an opportunity
  * The organization's identity affected the meanings members gave the issue. Two terms frequently applied were "moral issue" and "business issue."
  * The organization's identity was also significant in explaining the direction and level of emotional expression about the issue
  * The Port Authority's identity also produced positive emotions when organizational actions were identity-consistent. For example, opening the two drop-in centers in record-breaking style was a source of pride.
  * the concept of identity is helpful in understanding how actions were shaped
  * The Port Authority's identity offered implicit guidelines for evaluating the effectiveness of its actions on the issue
  * **an organization's identity is closely tied to its culture because identity provides a set of skills and a way of using and evaluating those skills that produce characteristic ways of doing thing**
  * An organization's identity is one of the vehicles through which "preconceptions determine appropriate action"
  * individuals' senses of the organization's identity did more than activate a set of familiar routines, that identity also constrained what were considered acceptable or legitimate solution
* In sum, a knowledge of individuals' beliefs about an organization's identity is crucial for discerning the importance of an issue, its meanings, and its emotionality. These interpretations, shaped by the organization's identity, move individuals' commitment, involvement, indifference, and resistance in particular directions and thereby direct and shape organizational actions.
* An organization's _identity_ describes what its members believe to be its character; an organization's _image_ describes attributes members believe people outside the organization use to distinguish it. Image is different from _reputation_ which describes the attributes outsiders ascribe to an organization.
* In the case of the Port Authority and its dealings with homelessness, image changes triggered the organization's later, more substantive response to the issue
* An organization's image is directly related to the level of collective self-esteem derivable from organizational membership
* As the story revealed, the damage to the organization's image hurt individuals personally
* As a result, individuals are strongly motivated and committed to take actions that will restore their organization's image.
* organizational actions on social issue can be especially character-enhancing or damning.
* Because image and identity are constructs that organization members hold in their minds, they actively screen and interpret issues
* **The connection between organization, employee's self-concepts, and their motivation to invest in and act on issues in particular ways uncovers a new way of thinking about the organizational adaptation process, a perspective in which organizational impression management is an important driving force in adaptation.**
* By linking individual motivation to organizational action, we begin to see new links between microprocesses and macro behaviors
* individuals in organizations keep one eye on the organizational mirror when they interpret, react, and commit to organizational actions

### Mission Mystique and a Belief System Template, Goodsell (2011)

* The notion called _mission mystique_ lays the basis for conscious development of strong organizational _belief systems_ that center on a compelling _public mission_.
* The institution becomes in effect endowed with a kind of magnetism or institution-level charisma
* The construct's underlying foundation permeates the institution's culture, animates its workforce and inspires a desire to improve
* Because of the underlying premise that coherence derives from a particular mission, each application of the template must be unique
* While the organization is a rational instrument to achieve other purposes, the institution and its work possess inherent worth
* the totality of the institution's rational and normative attributes forms a "distinctive competence" or character that sets it apart. **Essential ingredients of this competence are possession of a clearly defined mission and an embodiment of the mission's values.**
* Attaining good alignment involves picking leaders whose character and style match the type of organization
* Organizations acquire a collective character and identity over time, "historical efficiency"
* Three pillars of organizations:
  * regulative pillar - system of rules and rewards/punishments
  * normative pillar - set of values and norms, defines goals and prescribes means to attain them
  * cognitive pillar - frames meaning and manipulates it
* Four categories of cultural manifestation:
  * artifacts
  * behavior patterns
  * beliefs and values
  * basic assumptions
* Importance of concentrating on the success of public programs. According to Anne Khademian, the best ones:
  1. possess a robustness based on long history
  2. incorporate the value of program excellence at the team and individual levels
  3. strive for openness to change, learning, diversity, and systemic thinking
* organizational culture is not amenable to unilateral control. Instead, leaders must "work with the culture" as it evolves organically from these roots:
  1. organizational task or mission
  2. resources provided to accomplish that task
  3. the political environment's legacies, expectations, and constraints
* **"sense of mission" has little to do with a written statement, consists of a coherent set of authentically felt norms that possess genuine meaning for all employees**
* a model made up of four components:
  1. purpose
  2. strategy
  3. policies
  4. values
* direction and commitment of the organization as an entirety is best unleashed  by means of continuous, gradual change at all levels
* three devices of socialization:
  1. the formal mission statement
  2. credo or code of ethics
  3. current vision of the future
* synthesis of these devices becomes, ideally, a convincing conveyance of the institution's overall reason for being
* purpose statement can be said to look to both past and future
* James Weiss theory on the inner processes by which mission motivates and frames members of an organization:
  1. Structures of knowledge stemming from the mission process incoming information
  2. Mission motivates individuals by identifying a clear collective interests
  3. Existance of the mission assists in the making of decisions by offering reference points for weighing what actions are desirable
* Yoash Wiener theory of normative commitment in the organization based not on instrumental logic but on internalized moral beliefs
* Wiener measures organizational commitment by three variables:
  1. personal sacrifice to the organization
  2. heightened persistence and long tenure
  3. mental preoccupation with the work
* Gary Wamsley notion of an institution's constitution - relatively stable "rules of the game" which permeate its normative order. Functions to lay out common expectations of what actions are acceptable
* What does mission mystique in action look like?
  * A belief system
  * Set of key interconnected attributes present:
  * resulting construct is called a template rather than a model or blueprint
  * In sum institutions possess the following characteristics:
    1. direction
    2. importance
    3. confidence
    4. dedication
    5. community
    6. identity
    7. dissent
    8. policy space  
    9. renewal
* **More than any other quality, a strong sense of mission is indispensable to morale, image, and success.**
* The bottom line is that to contribute to mystique the mission should have two characteristics:
  1. a compelling "bite" - a crisp phrasing that captures the imagination
  2. a concept that is sufficiently simple that it can be absorbed and remembered
* The object is not clear expression but emotional voltage
* two separate but related attributes: a distinctive reputation and a solid record of achievement
* A mission mystique agency need not be the winner of a popularity contest, only the possessor of a _distinctive_ reputation
* The best route to good agency reputation is an existing record of achievement in its distinct area
* leaders should facilitate the development of an institutional belief system by initiating norm-creation processes
* nudge-but don't impose-cultural innovations
* discarding rather than reshaping a usable organizational culture can be wasteful and destroy morale
* The ideal mission mystique culture does several things:
  1. induces enthusiasm for the mission purpose
  2. reinforces individual employee motivation
  3. conveys a sense of work importance and the agency's competence doing it
  4. supports a willingness to recognize agency shortcomings and experiment with change
* The mission mystique ideal anticipates substantial cultural coherence
* an institution is an organization wrapped in values, also wrapped in memories. Must consider and honor importance of organization's past
* Over time, the mission mystique agency must be relentless in engaging in renewal processes by which continuous improvement is sought. To do so requires thoughtful strategies and habits of the mind. It should be innovative but not make a fetish out of change for its own sake. Integrity of the institution's distinctive competence must be preserved. Maintain connection with cultural roots yet always be ready to "rework" the culture when necessary.

### Bryson, chapter four - clarifying organizational mandates and mission

* Together mandates, mission, and values indicate the public value the organization will create and provide the social justification and legitimacy on which the organization’s existence depends.
* Before an organization can define its mission and values, it should know exactly what it is formally and informally required to do
  * Formal requirements are likely to be codified
  * variety of informal mandates that may be embodied in norms or the expectations of key stakeholders
* The purpose is to identify and clarify the nature and meaning of the externally imposed mandates affecting the organization. Four outcomes should be sought from this step:
  1. Identification of the organization’s formal and informal mandates
  2. Interpretation of what is required as a result of the mandates
  3. Clarification of what is forbidden by the mandates
  4. Clarification of what is not ruled out by the mandates
* By considering what the organization might or should do, organizational members and other key stakeholders can engage in valuable discussions about which mandates are useful,
* There are two potential longer-term desired outcomes
  1. clarity about what is mandated increases the likelihood that mandates will be met
  2. the possibility of developing a mission that is not limited to mandates is enhanced.
* The process guidelines for this step:
  1. Have someone compile the formal and informal mandates
  2. Review the mandates in order to clarify
  3. institutionalize attention to the mandates
  4. Undertake a regular review of the mandates
* without a sense of purpose we are quite literally lost. Mission provides that sense of purpose.
* Without a vision of success, organizational members may not know enough about how to fulfill the mission
* **Mission, in other words, clarifies an organization’s purpose, or _why_ it should be doing what it does; vision clarifies _what_ the organization should look like and _how_ it should behave in fulfilling its mission.**
* the foundation of any good vision of success is an organization’s mission statement
* Ultimately strategic planning is about purpose, meaning, values, and virtue.
* The aim of mission clarification is to specify the purposes of the organization and the philosophy and values that guide it.
* agreement on an organizational mission that embraces socially desirable and justified purposes should produce legitimacy internally and externally, as well as enthusiasm and excitement among organizational members
* **agreement helps fosters a habit of focusing deliberations on what is truly important.**
* To be blunt: If you are not paying attention to what is important, what good are you as a leader or follower?
* Because defining the mission may be thought of as the central function of leadership, more effective leadership is another outcome
  * helps articulate the purpose of organizational structures and systems,
  * provides a kind of _premise control_
  * leaders will be helped to guide internal conflict
* Agreement on purpose can also help the parties agree what goals are to be pursued, or problems addressed, prior to exploring other solutions
* Once an organization understands its purpose, it can define the problems it is meant to solve and can better understand how to choose among competing solutions.
* Another desired outcome is the explicit attention given to philosophy, values, and culture. Without understanding their philosophy, values, and culture, organizations are likely to make serious errors in the strategy formulation step.
* a stakeholder analysis forces team members to place themselves in the shoes of others—especially outsiders—and make a rather dispassionate assessment of the organization’s performance from the outsiders’ points of view.
* Stakeholder analysis is primarily just an input to other steps in the process
* **A mission statement is a declaration of organizational purpose. They are typically short—no more than a page, and often not more than a punchy slogan. They should also be targeted, activist in tone, and inspiring. And they should lead to measures that will indicate whether or not the mission is being achieved.**
* Strategic planning should not be allowed to get in the way of useful action. However, it is important to remember that strategic planning _is_ ultimately about purpose, meaning, value, and virtue, and therefore is philosophical at its base.
* Peter Drucker six Socratic questions for strategic planning:
  1. Who are we?
  2. What are the basic social and political needs we exist to meet?
  3. In general, what do we do to recognize, anticipate, and respond to these needs or problems?
  4. How should we respond to our key stakeholders?
  5. What are our philosophy, values, and culture?
  6. What makes us distinctive or unique?
* Several process guidelines should be kept in mind as a strategic planning group works at clarification of mission and mandates:
  1. Someone should be put in charge of compiling the organization’s formal and informal mandates.
  2. The group should complete a stakeholder analysis
  3. After completing the stakeholder analysis, the group should fill out mission statement worksheets
  4. Develop a draft mission statement
  5. Do not get stalled by development of a mission statement
    * If the group hits a snag, record areas of agreement and disagreement, then move on
  6. Expect to have to reexamine their draft mission statement while moving through the process
  7. Once agreement is reached on a mission statement, it should be kept in front of the strategic planning group as it moves through the planning process.
    * The organization’s mission provides a basis for resolving conflicts based on purposes and interests, not positions
  8. Once general agreement is reached, the mission should be visibly before all organizational members.
    * The organization that forgets its mission will drift
  9. Adoption of the organization’s mission marks an important decision point.
  10. Organizations not engaged in a full-blown strategic planning process may still want to hold mission retreats periodically to reaffirm and/or revisit and modify their mission.
* Mandates are typically imposed from the outside. Mission is developed more from the inside.
* Mandates and mission jointly frame the domain within which the organization seeks to create public value.
* Creating lasting public value requires that the enduring benefits of what the organization does do and does not do must significantly outweigh the costs.

## Strategic Human Resources Management

### An Inspiriting Alternative: Partnership, Moxley (2000)

* Leadership had predominantly been understood as something an individual provides. This is the industrial model. It is time to try another way of understanding and practicing leadership
* Alternative: leadership as _partnership_. Basic concept of two or more people sharing power and joining forces.
* It is understanding that leadership is an activity that happens in and comes from a collective. In this view leadership is not something that one individual provides to another, but rather results from the _reciprocity of relationships._
* Leadership is cocreated
* Partnerships also suggest interdependence
* **In partnerships, leadership is understood more as a verb than a noun**
* Partnerships work when power is shared. Ego is still important, but now each person's needs are acknowledged and honored, minimizing the chance that the ego needs of a single person dominate
* In partnerships, leadership is not an outside-in process. Not forcing alignment with an executive's vision, or "them" doing something for "us." Partnership model is an inside-out process, surfacing the meaning and purpose that partners bring to their work and want from it.
* Partnership is the activity that evokes and involves spirit. Has the capacity to move us to the unseen force at the core of our being with a sense of meaning (spirit).
* Five requirements for the partnership model to work:
  1. Balance of power
  2. Shared purpose
  3. Shared responsibility
  4. Respect for the person
  5. Partnering in the nitty-gritty
* Command-and-control appears more efficient, but whenever coercive power flows one way in a relationship resentment and hostility flow in the other.
* Partnerships happen in simple experiences of work
* Directive leadership by a single individual is less important than that the team knows how to function together as a close-knit unit
* There is a growing realization that a **vision cannot be imposed**, that instead must emerge from the interaction of team members
*
