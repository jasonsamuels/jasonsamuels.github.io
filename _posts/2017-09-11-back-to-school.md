A few months ago I enrolled in the University of Minnesota Humphrey School to pursue a graduate certificate in nonprofit management. I have a dozen years experience working in the nonprofit sector and currently work full time as the IT Operations Manager for a nonprofit. I love the work I do now leading technology change to better meet our mission. I want to continue and expand that work for years to come, and am convinced that pursuing higher education will better equip me for my job right now and in the future.
