## Strategic Planning (SP)

### Creating Public Value Using Performance Information, Kroll and Moynihan (2015)

The structure of this article was a little different in that it ends with a conclusion section which effectively outlined and rehashed the rest of the article. As such this outline is going to start with that and then fill in details (as opposed to most of my outlines which just follow the article structure).

Noted that the section on Perverse use of performance management mirrors a theme which Prof. Jay has touched on in SHRM, in the context of why monetary performance bonuses don't have a strong track record in the public sector

* <b>Performance systems have become a key way through which public value is represented.</b>
  * Over time, public organizations became increasingly focused on rules at the expense of organizational goals, contributing to inefficiency and a growing loss of public trust- a loss of public value
  * reforms promise to redirect attention toward the mission and goals of organizations
  * the doctrine of performance management explicitly invokes certain values- most obviously efficiency and effectiveness but also transparency, accountability, and the legitimacy of the state.
  * mandates to implement performance management have boiled down to a few key processes
    * requiring public agencies to identify their mission
    * set strategic goals and performance targets
    * track measurable indicators of performance
    * broadly disseminate this data
* <b>Creating performance information is a political act</b>
* <b>Performance management systems tend to privilege certain values and displace others</b>
  * A critique of performance management processes is that they tend to privilege certain values over others
  * understandable that managers focus attention on goal achievement, notion is that = primary basis for public legitimacy, assumption is contestable, one study showed confidence in due process and equity of treatment as more important
* <b>The relationship between performance data and public value depends upon how the data is used</b>
  * There is no automatic connection between measurement and improvements in agency performance or in outcomes
* <b>The key benefits of performance systems lie in encouraging purposeful use of performance data</b>
  * Four ways that performance measures are used:
    1. Purposeful use of data
    2. Passive use of data
      * where public managers use data only to comply with the procedural requirements but for little else.
    3. Political use of data
      * using performance information is to create political legitimacy and support
      * can fulfill the function of "promoting" or "advocating"
      * The existing work on political performance information use does not suggest that it is inherently helpful or damaging to public value but simply a reflection of how performance systems are increasingly integrated
      * In some cases these processes place unrealistic and countervailing demands on public organizations; in other cases they can be used to protect and strengthen public organizations.
      * most positive terms, the political use of performance information may be seen as part of a pluralistic dialogue through which public value is actively negotiated
      * often serves an external purpose: it is used to meet the expectations of external stakeholders and to portray public organizations as modern and performance-driven even as internal management processes remain unaffected -- "organizational hypocrisy"
    4. Perverse use
      * when agents use performance data in ways clearly at odds with public value, such as:
        * gaming - creatively interpreting numbers
        * cheating - making up numbers
        * effort substitution - focusing on easy or highly rewarded targets
        * cream skimming - excluding more difficult-to-serve populations
          * these responses become more likely under certain circumstances
          * High-stakes rewards to achieve measured performance create an incentive for perverse behavior
          * Qualitative accounts of employees working under these conditions reveal a sense of helplessness and frustration among frontline employees
          * critically important that the perversity of performance systems be addressed and minimized where possible
          * types of perverse behavior have been documented enough that they should be seen not as inherently unusual but as a systematic risk that elected officials need to consider in the design of performance systems
* <b>Establishing purposeful use is not easy</b>
  * purposeful use of performance data in decision making is the element most closely linked to the improvement of outputs and outcomes
  * Understanding its dynamics and antecedents is critical to designing systems and creating a supportive environment that makes it easy for public managers to use performance data in a way that aligns with public value
  * Most important antecedents:
    1. Environmental factors
      * involvement of external stakeholders
      * political environment
      * general political support
    2. Organizational support
      * leadership support
      * support capacity - an investment in the know-how and technology needed to analyze data and produce usable reports
    3. Performance management system design
      * sophistication of the measurement system - variety, usefulness, and accessibility of data
      * quality of the data
      * involvement of line managers and employees in developing systems - fosters support and buy-in
      * creation of learning routines to encourage use of the data
    4. Generic organizational factors
      * organizational culture
        * innovative culture
      * existence of goal clarity
    5. Individual factors
      * managers matter
      * reforms are more likely to success when there is a convincing narrative
      * managers' motivation
      * growing evidence that purposeful performance information use can be better achieved by appealing to the prosocial motivation of helping others and making a difference in society  
* <b>Set realistic expectations for performance management</b>
  * There is much practical work to be done to design performance systems to better relate performance indicators to the desire of employees to make a difference.
  * sociodemographic differences (age, gender, education, position, experience, etc.) appear to matter little to data use
  * **Networking behavior can be positively associated with purposeful use, however**
  * managers have a stronger incentive to use performance data if they are able to change processes autonomously and to determine how to achieve their goals

## Strategic Human Resources Management (SHRM)

###  Should Hiring Be Based on Gut - or Data?, Knowledge @ Wharton (2015)

* How useful is data in human resources as opposed to "trusting your gut"?
* Both helpfulness and niceness may be predictive of success in many jobs
* Duckworth studies a different personality trait: grit
  * defined as "passion and perseverance, especially for long-term goals"
  * same concept was studied in the 80s by ETS, called "productive follow-through"
    * ETS study - essentially, sticking with a couple of activities through high school and achieving success in them was rated higher than doing a wider variety of different things
* Motivating, meaningful work has been found to increase employees' engagement, but exactly what is it that makes work meaningful?
  * Many people will have a combination of motivations
  * External motivations appear to have a dampening effect on internal motivations
  * "overjustification effect"

### Key Challenges facing HR and Management in 2016, Maidment (2015)

1. Attraction and retention of top talent
2. Collaboration
  * 40% of employees do not feel they belong to a collaborative culture, whereas 80% of global organizations regard teamwork as one of their strengths
  * In order to create a high performing team, key areas for improvement need to be addressed in an open and honest way
3. Learning and development
  * 50% of employees feel they are not receiving enough training
4. Agility
  * 46% of employees are concerned about the time it takes for key decisions to be made
5. recognition
  * Employees feel demotivated without regular positive feedback and a clear performance management framework in place
6. Strategic thinking and planning
7. Managing a diverse workforce, including Millennials
8. Innovation
  * Should be included in workplace competencies and assessed from selection to promotion
9. Managing the company reputation - both on and offline
  * organizations have reminded again and again of the need to adhere to vision and values and demonstrate authentic leadership
10. Managing workload and promoting workplace well-being
  * Stress continues to account for at least 35% of actual work related ill health
  * Recent government study suggests that an overall improvement in well-being will result in improved productivity, profitability, and quality

### Reasonable human resource practices for making employee downsizing decisions, Campion, Guerrero, Posthuma (2011)

This article deals with a somewhat uncomfortable topic. I found myself wincing at a few points where it coldly explains ways to approach employee firings that will shield the company from liability. Ultimately though, I know rationally that layoffs are a part of business and the intent of the article is to provide advice on how to approach them fairly (and warns to not take see downsizing as a panacea for business improvements).

* downsizing seems to be a common practice regardless of the economic situation
* Recently, researchers and practitioners have begun to **question the effectiveness of downsizing as a turnaround strategy**
* HR should aim to use practices that minimize negative effects on both terminated and surviving employees
* we propose a set of eight reasonable HR practices that can benefit and protect both the employer and the employee
1. Identify the business need for downsizing
  * decision to downsize shouldn't be made lightly, does not always lead to improvements
  * there may be a business need, in particular if aligned with other strategic changes
  * decision to downsize should be made based on the long term health of the company
2. Communicate with employees throughout the process
  *  increased communication is one of the most important factors in reducing the negative consequences of downsizing
3. Identify future work
  1. Identify future jobs and tasks to be performed
    * Some downsizing experts recommend a formal skill needs analysis
  2. Identify future knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) and experience requirements
4. Determine criteria to evaluate employees against future work
  1. Emphasize job-related criteria
    *  If job-related criteria are not explicitly used, decision makers are likely to use vague criteria
  2. Emphasize objective (vs. subjective) criteria
    * Objective measures improve accuracy of measurement, and improve perceptions of fairness
  3. Consider past job performance heavily
    * extensive evidence that past job performance predicts future job performance
  4. Consider seniority
  5. Avoid inherently age-related criteria
5. Establish fair evaluation procedures
  1. Use multiple independent evaluators
    * combinations of judgments of multiple independent evaluators of human attributes are more reliable than the judgment of a single evaluator
    * can provide a check against potential biases and help prevent discrimination
  2. Provide clear instructions and train evaluators on the decision-making process and EEO considerations
    * evaluation materials should contain clear instructions so that managers understand what specific judgements they need to make
  3. Base selections on accurate and complete information
  4. Prevent exposure of demographic information to evaluators
    * evaluators should not be exposed to information on the protected group membership of the employees
  5. Apply methodology in a consistent and fair manner
  6. Allow employees to compete for remaining or new positions throughout the organization
  7. Establish an appeal mechanism
    * may uncover additional information that could change the decision
  8. Maintain adequate documentation
    * reduces the potential for discrimination by demonstrating that specific procedures were followed
6. Analyze adverse impact
  1. Conduct analyses in a timely fashion
  2. Take action if adverse impact is shown
7. Evaluate the process and outcomes
8. Ensure an informed and independent Human Resources staff
  * If the HR staff is not empowered, they may be reluctant to question or resist senior management downsizing decisions, even if these decisions are viewed as unjust

### Retaining Talent: Replacing Misconceptions With Evidence-Based Strategies, Allen, Bryant, Vardaman (2010)

This article bridges the gap between science and practice in the area of employee turnover, and replaces several misconceptions about turnover with guidelines for evidence-based retention management strategies

* There is evidence that high unemployment rates have little impact on the turnover of high-performing employees or those with in-demand skill sets
* large-scale layoffs in difficult times often lead to higher turnover among survivors
* likelihood that many current employees may remain with their organizations only because there are fewer external opportunities leads to the possibility for substantial pent-up turnover to occur
* misconceptions about turnover can be harmful to organizations, may lead to ineffective retention strategies
* Five misconceptions:
  1. All Turnover Is the Same, and It Is All Bad
    * turnover is a complex phenomenon. Not always harmful, may even be beneficial
    * distinction between _voluntary_ and _involuntary_ turnover.
    * within voluntary turnover, important distinction between _dysfunctional_ and _functional_ turnover
      * dysfunctional is harmful to the organization, such as the exit of high performers or difficult-to-replace skill sets
      * functional may not be harmful, may even be beneficial
      * Retention management strategies focus more on dysfunctional turnover
    * while some turnover is _avoidable_, some turnover will always be _unavoidable_
    * two primary types of costs associated with voluntary turnover: separation costs and replacement costs
    * From a strategic perspective, organizations need a clear shared understanding of the costs and benefits associated with turnover
    * There is no single appropriate formulation
    * Important that there is internal consensus that metrics are appropriate
    * evidence links turnover rates to performance
    * impact of turnover rates on organizational performance may also be a function of who is exiting
    * turnover among employees with high social capital has a strong negative impact
    * emerging consensus that it may soon become more challenging for organizations to retain their key employees
    * **shared understanding of turnover effects and trends may achieve a competitive advantage**
  2. People Quit Because of Pay
    * pay level and pay satisfaction are relatively weak predictors of individual turnover decisions
    * **organizational equilibrium = individuals will continue to participate in the organization as long as the inducements offered by the organization are equal to or greater than the contributions required by the organization**
    * inducements can be specific, tangible rewards such as pay, there can also be other types of inducements such as working conditions, relationships, or future opportunities
    * actively manage individual turnover decisions by managing the inducements-contributions balance
    * withdrawal process typically involves thoughts of quitting, job search, evaluation and comparison of alternative opportunities, turnover intentions, and eventually turnover behavior. Organizations and managers can monitor and manage
    * plentiful opportunities become an especially difficult issue for retention: not only do employees have high ease of movement, but they may also be more difficult to keep satisfied.
    * The strongest turnover predictors tend to be related to the withdrawal process, such as turnover intentions and job search
    * commitment and job satisfaction are two of the most important turnover drivers
    * relationship an individual employee has with his/her immediate supervisor/manager plays a critical role
    * Role clarity and role conflict are important
    * Job design and the work environment matter: work satisfaction, job scope, promotion opportunities, communication, and participation in decision making are moderately related
    * workgroup cohesion and coworker satisfaction are moderately related
    * Demographics are relatively weak predictors: education, marital status, sex, and race are only weakly related to turnover
  3. People Quit Because They Are Dissatisfied With Their Jobs
    * true that job dissatisfaction is one of the most consistent attitudinal predictors, however might be the driving force in fewer than half of individual turnover decisions
    * unfolding model identifies four primary paths to turnover, often initiated by shock (an expected or unexpected event that leads someone to consider quitting):
      1. leaving an unsatisfying job
      2. leaving for a more attractive alternative
      3. individuals who have scripts or plans in mind that involve considering quitting in response to certain events
      4. individuals who quit despite being relatively satisfied, without having a script in place, and perhaps even without searching for an alternative. These are likely impulsive quits
    * **Just as important as why people leave is why people stay - cocept of _job embeddedness_**
    * three types of connections:
      1. links - connections with other people, groups, or organizations
      2. fit - extent to which an employee sees themselves as compatible with the job
      3. sacrifice - what would be given up by leaving the job
  4. There is little managers can do to directly influence turnover decisions
    * true that some instances of turnover are unavoidable, however specific cause-effect relationships and HR practices can help organizations manage turnover
    * two phases: managing organization entry and the work environment
  5. A simple one-size-fits-all retention strategy is most effective
    * Effective retention management requires ongoing diagnosis of the nature and causes of turnover
    * Two primary types of retention strategies:
      * _systemic strategies_ based on general principles
      * _targeted strategies_ based on more organization-specific issues
      * not mutually exclusive, though it is strategically advantageous to focus on efforts that are most closely tied to organization's competitive strategy
    * Major barrier to good decision making = tendency to use a narrow decision frames
    * managers should broaden their decision frames in three ways:
      1. consider multiple objectives and issues
      2. evaluate alternative expected outcomes
      3. consider multiple alternatives
    * major steps in developing a strategic evidence-based approach to retention management:
      1. conduct a thorough turnover analysis
      2. interpret this analysis through the lens of a particular organizational context
      3. collect data to diagnose and adapt cause-effect relationships in a particular organizational context
* first step to developing ability to diagnose and adapt is to determine the extent to which turnover is a problem
* Benchmarking and needs assessment are methods for assessing turnover data in relation to both internal and external circumstances
  * External benchmarking compares organization turnover rates against industry and competitor rates
  * Internal benchmarking considers organization turnover rates over time
* There are some cases where stable or even decreasing turnover could be considered problematic, such as if the organization is retaining too many poor performers, or if organizational plans call for changing the makeup of the workforce
* **Needs assessment enables evaluation of turnover in context**
* Turnover data analysis viewed through the lens of organizational context enables the organization to develop data-based retention goals
* an evidence-based approach to identifying the appropriate strategy requires collecting data on the systemic strategies that are most likely to be effective
* One result of the data collection and diagnosis process may be finding that some groups or types of employees leave for different reasons than others
