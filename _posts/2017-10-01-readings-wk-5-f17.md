### Creating Public Value Using Performance Information, Kroll and Moynihan (2015)

The structure of this article was a little different in that it ends with a conclusion section which effectively outlined and rehashed the rest of the article. As such this outline is going to start with that and then fill in details (as opposed to most of my outlines which just follow the article structure).

Noted that the section on Perverse use of performance management mirrors a theme which Prof. Jay has touched on in SHRM, in the context of why monetary performance bonuses don't have a strong track record in the public sector

* <b>Performance systems have become a key way through which public value is represented.</b>
  * Over time, public organizations became increasingly focused on rules at the expense of organizational goals, contributing to inefficiency and a growing loss of public trust- a loss of public value
  * reforms promise to redirect attention toward the mission and goals of organizations
  * the doctrine of performance management explicitly invokes certain values- most obviously efficiency and effectiveness but also transparency, accountability, and the legitimacy of the state.
  * mandates to implement performance management have boiled down to a few key processes
    * requiring public agencies to identify their mission
    * set strategic goals and performance targets
    * track measurable indicators of performance
    * broadly disseminate this data
* <b>Creating performance information is a political act</b>
* <b>Performance management systems tend to privilege certain values and displace others</b>
  * A critique of performance management processes is that they tend to privilege certain values over others
  * understandable that managers focus attention on goal achievement, notion is that = primary basis for public legitimacy, assumption is contestable, one study showed confidence in due process and equity of treatment as more important
* <b>The relationship between performance data and public value depends upon how the data is used</b>
  * There is no automatic connection between measurement and improvements in agency performance or in outcomes
* <b>The key benefits of performance systems lie in encouraging purposeful use of performance data</b>
  * Four ways that performance measures are used:
    1. Purposeful use of data
    2. Passive use of data
      * where public managers use data only to comply with the procedural requirements but for little else.
    3. Political use of data
      * using performance information is to create political legitimacy and support
      * can fulfill the function of "promoting" or "advocating"
      * The existing work on political performance information use does not suggest that it is inherently helpful or damaging to public value but simply a reflection of how performance systems are increasingly integrated
      * In some cases these processes place unrealistic and countervailing demands on public organizations; in other cases they can be used to protect and strengthen public organizations.
      * most positive terms, the political use of performance information may be seen as part of a pluralistic dialogue through which public value is actively negotiated
      * often serves an external purpose: it is used to meet the expectations of external stakeholders and to portray public organizations as modern and performance-driven even as internal management processes remain unaffected -- "organizational hypocrisy"
    4. Perverse use
      * when agents use performance data in ways clearly at odds with public value, such as:
        * gaming - creatively interpreting numbers
        * cheating - making up numbers
        * effort substitution - focusing on easy or highly rewarded targets
        * cream skimming - excluding more difficult-to-serve populations
      * these responses become more likely under certain circumstances
      * High-stakes rewards to achieve measured performance create an incentive for perverse behavior
      * Qualitative accounts of employees working under these conditions reveal a sense of helplessness and frustration among frontline employees
      * critically important that the perversity of performance systems be addressed and minimized where possible
      * types of perverse behavior have been documented enough that they should be seen not as inherently unusual but as a systematic risk that elected officials need to consider in the design of performance systems
* <b>Establishing purposeful use is not easy</b>
  * purposeful use of performance data in decision making is the element most closely linked to the improvement of outputs and outcomes
  * Understanding its dynamics and antecedents is critical to designing systems and creating a supportive environment that makes it easy for public managers to use performance data in a way that aligns with public value
  * Most important antecedents:
    1. Environmental factors
      * involvement of external stakeholders
      * political environment
      * general political support
    2. Organizational support
      * leadership support
      * support capacity - an investment in the know-how and technology needed to analyze data and produce usable reports
    3. Performance management system design
      * sophistication of the measurement system - variety, usefulness, and accessibility of data
      * quality of the data
      * involvement of line managers and employees in developing systems - fosters support and buy-in
      * creation of learning routines to encourage use of the data
    4. Generic organizational factors
      * organizational culture
        * innovative culture
      * existence of goal clarity
    5. Individual factors
      * managers matter
      * reforms are more likely to success when there is a convincing narrative
      * managers' motivation
      * growing evidence that purposeful performance information use can be better achieved by appealing to the prosocial motivation of helping others and making a difference in society  
* <b>Set realistic expectations for performance management</b>
  * There is much practical work to be done to design performance systems to better relate performance indicators to the desire of employees to make a difference.
  * sociodemographic differences (age, gender, education, position, experience, etc.) appear to matter little to data use
  * **Networking behavior can be positively associated with purposeful use, however**
  * managers have a stronger incentive to use performance data if they are able to change processes autonomously and to determine how to achieve their goals
