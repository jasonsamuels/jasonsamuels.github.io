Hi, I'm Jason. Welcome to my learning blog.

I'm currently enrolled in the University of Minnesota Humphrey School pursuing a graduate-level Certificate in Nonprofit Management. I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a bachelor's degree in history and political science in 2004, and now have over a dozen years experience working in the nonprofit sector. My full time job is IT Operations Manager for the [American Craft Council](https://craftcouncil.org/). I love the work I do leading technology change to better meet our mission, and this pursuit of higher education is about developing skills that can equip me to be even more effective at that.

This blog is roughly 20% my personal ramblings and reflections about the experience of being a student again / 80% excessively long bullet point outlines of course materials and lectures. The purposes that this blog serves are personal, they're an outlet for my thoughts and a practical tool that I'm using to synthesize what I'm learning. Putting that all out on a public platform is an experiment in radical transparency. Deep down I'm glad that you're reading, I hope that you find the content informative and thought provoking. And if you're a classmate, I hope this inspires you to share your own notes and reflections as well, so that I and others can learn from your perspective too.

So welcome and enjoy. If you'd like to chat, reach out using one of the links below.
