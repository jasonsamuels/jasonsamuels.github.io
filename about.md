Hi, I'm Jason. Welcome to my learning blog.

I completed a graduate-level Certificate in Nonprofit Management from the University of Minnesota Humphrey School in May 2018. I have over a dozen years experience working in the nonprofit sector, and my full time job is IT Operations Manager for the [American Craft Council](https://craftcouncil.org/). I love the work of leading technology change to better meet our mission, and my pursuit of higher education is about developing capacity to become even more effective at that.

This blog consists of roughly 20% personal ramblings and reflections about the experience of being a student again / 80% excessively long bullet point outlines of course materials and lectures. This blog is personal in nature, an outlet for my thoughts and a practical tool to synthesize learnings. Putting that all out on a public platform was an experiment in radical transparency. I'm truly glad that you're reading and hopeful that you learn something.
