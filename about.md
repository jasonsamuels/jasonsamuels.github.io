Hi, I'm Jason. Welcome to my learning blog.

I completed a graduate-level Certificate in Nonprofit Management at the University of Minnesota Humphrey School in May 2018, and am currently pursuing a Masters in Public Affairs as a member of the 2024-25 mid-career cohort. 

I have almost twenty years experience working in the nonprofit sector, and currently work full-time for [W4Sight](https://w4sight.com/) as a software consultant to nonprofits and foundations. I love the work of helping organizations better leverage IT to meet their mission.

My pursuit of higher education is about leaning in to leadership, building capacity to make greater impacts, and getting out of the house to break up the monotony of Zoom meetings all day. All of those things seem to me like solid goals for personal growth in 2024.

This blog is personal in nature, an outlet for my thoughts and a practical tool to synthesize learnings. This blog was an experiment in radical transparency. I’m truly glad that you’re reading and hope you find it useful.
