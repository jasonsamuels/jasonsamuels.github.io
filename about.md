A few months ago I enrolled in the University of Minnesota Humphrey School to pursue a graduate certificate in nonprofit management. I have a dozen years experience working in the nonprofit sector and currently work full time as the IT Operations Manager for a nonprofit. I love the work I do now leading technology change to better meet our mission. I want to continue and expand that work for years to come, and am pursuing higher education to become better equipped to be effective at that now and in the future.
