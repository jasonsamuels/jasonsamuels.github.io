Hi, I'm Jason. Welcome to my learning blog.

I completed a graduate-level Certificate in Nonprofit Management from the University of Minnesota Humphrey School in May 2018. I have almost twenty years experience working in the nonprofit sector, and my full time job is a software consultant for [W4Sight](https://w4sight.com/). I love the work of helping organizations leverage data systems to better meet their mission, and my pursuit of higher education is about developing capacity to become even more effective at that.

This blog is personal in nature, an outlet for my thoughts and a practical tool to synthesize learnings. This blog was an experiment in radical transparency. I’m truly glad that you’re reading and hope you find it useful.
